""Our main objective is trying to convince the Trump administration that this is not the best way to solve differences, neither between the US and China, neither between the US and Europe and the rest of the world,"" said Dominique de Villepin, former French prime minister, on the sidelines of the Belt and Road Forum for Interconnected Land-Sea Development held in Chongqing. US President Donald Trump ""considers every single competitor around the world might be a rival or a strategic enemy, and that has explained some of the decisions he has taken recently, for example on Mexico and the European Union"". China and the US have been engaged in a trade dispute for months. The tension has been escalating since they reached a deadlock, as Washington backtracked three times in the trade negotiations, according to a white paper on China's position on the trade talks released by the Chinese government on Sunday. The former prime minister of France said that European countries and China share a common interest in defending globalization and fighting against protectionism. He suggested the two sides should find a best possible solution to this ""trade war"" and implement some of the solutions between the EU and China in order to provide an example for the US. ""The message to the US should be that they can get more through cooperation than through confrontation. I believe Europe and China should open a new way and show a good example that cooperation is more fruitful than confrontation,"" he said. Following the US increasing tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods on May 10 from 10 percent to 25 percent, Washington has recently threatened to impose tariffs on other countries, including Mexico. Trump said last week that he would place 5 percent tariffs on all Mexican imports beginning June 10 - if Mexico cannot solve the issue of undocumented migrants - and gradually increase them to 25 percent. Former president of Slovenia Danilo Turk said that the principles China emphasized in the white paper, such as equality and respect, are important for the world and are basic principles for economic cooperation. ""The solution for this problem can only be multilateral. It is not only about China and the US, it is about everybody,"" Turk said. ""Tariffs are considered inadequate for the management of economic cooperation in the 21st century. We have to get together and figure out a system that ensures everybody wins on some important issues."" Mizengo Kayanza Peter Pinda, former prime minister of Tanzania, said China set a good example for other countries with its will to work together with the US to find solutions concerning differences and to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. ""The big issue is not the size of a country, but the legal position of each nation. Each nation, small or big, is a nation recognized internationally,"" Pinda said. Only by treating others equally and with respect can a country reach a win-win deal, he added. The international event attracted over 150 political leaders, experts and entrepreneurs from about 30 countries to discuss the development on the New International Land-Sea Trade Corridor.",2019-06-04 10:49,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201906/04/WS5cf5dc3ca310519142700f37.html,chinese,South China Sea dispute

The good was that both the Chinese and United States militaries expressed the resolve to prevent their countries' inflammatory trade tit-for-tat from hijacking their ties. The bad was they will continue looking at each other with suspicion, which means relations will stay prone to misjudgments. Both parties have portrayed the meeting between Chinese Defense Minister Wei Fenghe and US acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan Friday as ""constructive"", and reiterated their mutual commitment to positive engagement. However, the most reassuring take-away from the past weekend, the annual Shangri-La Dialogue appeared very much what it has been for years, a venue for articulating prepared messages. The key message Chinese participants brought to Singapore was: ""The United States should not underestimate China's determination, will and capabilities to safeguard its sovereignty and territory."" Their US counterparts sounded like they were on a different frequency. Though he stopped short of calling out Beijing by name, Shanahan bashed ""someone in our region"" for employing a ""toolkit of coercion"", which he said includes island-building, deploying advanced weapons systems in disputed areas, engaging in predatory economics and the state-sponsored theft of military and civilian technologies. These allegations are reminiscent of the escalating war of words over trade, from which Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong saw a hardening of attitudes to each other, and observed: ""The fundamental problem between the US and China is a mutual lack of strategic trust."" Such mistrust cannot be more obvious than in the US Defense Department's Indo-Pacific Strategy Report, which describes the China-US competition in the region as ""defined by geopolitical rivalry between free and repressive world order visions,"" reinforcing the Cold War-style notion that Beijing is a threat to the current world order. Since the report is based on misrepresentation of Beijing's strategic purposes, there is no way it can present a cool-headed analysis of the region's state of affairs. The hostility it perceives in Beijing's corresponding moves will only serve to increase the likelihood of a misjudgment. As the report highlights the belief that ""A free and open Indo-Pacific rests on a foundation of mutual respect, responsibility, priorities, and accountability"", Washington may want to ask what it is contributing to such a foundation. Are its words and deeds regarding Taiwan and the South China Sea conducive to it?",2019-06-02 22:02,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201906/02/WS5cf3d6e1a3104842260bf0da.html,chinese,South China Sea dispute

That is what many assume the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore will be. But it wouldn't have been that way if the United States had played by the rules and honored its word.

That Wei is the highest ranking Chinese official to participate in the three-day dialogue that started on Friday since 2011 makes it clear how important the event has become for China. It was in Singapore last year that James Mattis, then US secretary of defense, proposed the ""Indo-Pacific strategy"" to woo India and some Southeast Asian countries to join Washington in containing China. But the fact that the targeted countries have not bitten the US' bait should remind Shanahan that these countries' close trade and cultural relations with China are the bedrock of regional peace and prosperity, and none of them would sacrifice its development for non-existing threats. Although China has welcomed the US to contribute to regional cooperation and stability, the US has continued driving wedges between China and its neighbors. As part of its offensive design, US ships have already conducted two ""freedom of navigation"" operations near China's islands in the South China Sea this month, when usually they conduct one every two months or so. The US' military tactics, however, have not hampered China's development and its peaceful rise. Yet Washington needs to pat its own back to win the support of its allies to strengthen its presence in the region and ask Congress to hike the Pentagon's budget. If China indeed poses a threat to the region, why inter-military communication and exchanges between China and the US were so efficient and productive when Mattis was in office, and why was Mattis received by President Xi Jinping in Beijing in June 2018, and why did he meet with Wei three times in five months last year? Considering the first meeting between Shanahan and Wei is constructive, it could prompt the two sides to make efforts to strengthen communication, explore new areas of cooperation, and deepen mutual understanding and trust between their militaries.",2019-05-31 21:35,https://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201905/31/WS5cf12d90a3104842260bef23.html,chinese,South China Sea dispute
5,EnglishZhongGuoRiBao-2019-05-25 08:30-5,Trump's Huawei action has deep consequences,"We need to look beyond the outrage and indignation created by US President Donald Trump's executive order effectively banning US companies from doing business with Huawei. If we focus only on indignation about Huawei, then we allow ""a leaf to obscure the view of Mount Tai"", as the saying goes. Important as Huawei is, there are much bigger issues at stake for China's trade and investment. The executive order follows the precedent set when Trump used vague security grounds to unilaterally impose tariffs on steel. This was the first warning shot â and to their discredit, affected economies tried to tackle the consequences individually rather than by banding together and working within the established global rules-based order. This uncoordinated response laid waste to that order and set a direct path to the executive order that has hit Huawei hard. But the consequences are wider than just Huawei, because it involves an international logistics chain being bullied and intimidated by a single country. No one, friend or foe, is immune to this rogue-like behavior. Let's start at the beginning. The charges against Huawei have not been substantiated, and despite offers by Huawei for a full and open inspection the offer has not been taken up. Yet the ""security threat"" narrative continues. The security and compliance concerns about Huawei are a fig leaf designed to distract from a much broader agenda. Huawei is the only serious competitor to Apple iPhone in terms of quality, features and price. Huawei takes a leadership position in 5G applications and AI development. The attempt to destroy Huawei is an attempt to destroy competition to US industry and products. It is a vicious form of protectionism that goes beyond simple tariffs. It increasingly appears that part of ""Make America Great Again"" involves denying the right of China to continue to advance and improve living standards. This is also seen in statements that demand China abandons its Made in China programs. For what reason would they have to do this except hold back China's progress? This executive order opens the door to de-facto unilateral sanctions. The refusal to supply Huawei today is an unofficial sanction and tomorrow it may be applied to another Chinese company, or a European competitor for an American product. How easy it is to tweet, or draft an executive order, that applies de-facto sanctions to Chinese companies listed on NASDAQ and the NYSE. No need to attack them directly, because an executive order can sever their supply chains or prevent fund transfers through US co-respondent banks. The withdrawal of Beijing-based Kunlun from the US market following US government pressure is an early precursor of this danger. Shall we apply this to electric cars? To solar panels? To washing machines, air conditioners and refrigerators? To Chinese investment in international business? To companies that are supplying raw materials to China â materials like iron ore, which are suddenly deemed strategic? Despite not being a signatory to treaties like the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the United States is fond of scolding China about the need to observe the global rules-based order while reserving for itself the right to undermine, ignore and sabotage those very rules. It is a mistake to think the Huawei issue is just between the United States and China. These practices could be just as easily applied to Europe, South America, the UK and Australia. The solution lies in resolute, coordinated and cooperative support for the existing structures of the global rules-based order, including WTO dispute resolution mechanisms. Business councils and business representatives, along with organizations like the Silk Road Chamber of International Commerce, must be strong supporters and advocates. This is not just about Huawei or China. It is about the survival of a global rules-based trading environment from which all benefit.

6,EnglishZhongGuoRiBao-2019-05-13 07:14-6,Asian values needed in new context,"Guanxi, compadrazgo and bapakism. Three words from China, the Philippines and Indonesia that encapsulate the same values of the vast continent through the agesï¼a shared belief in the importance of the family and the community over the individual. These values, rooted on Asia's culture and history and centered on consensus, social harmony, stability and discipline, are more important and relevant than ever in the face of challengesï¼such as protectionism and terrorismï¼confronting the world today. Joefe Santarita, dean of the Asian Center at the University of the Philippines, said Asian values promote consensual approach and communitarianism rather than individualism, and they prioritize social order and harmony as well as respect for elders, discipline and a paternalistic state along with the primary role of government in economic development. ""Asian values are the salient ingredients on how to learn to work together through trust and consequently promote globalization,"" Santarita told China Daily. He cited China's guanxi, a cultural concept that stresses deep personal connections and maintaining relations. ""Guanxi is a clear manifestation of a success story of a cultural element that is aptly applied in the business sector. Trust is a fundamental element for Chinese businessmen who have engaged in commercial partnerships and international trading systems for centuries,"" he said. Santarita said a similar concept can also be found in other Asian countries, citing the Philippines' compadrazgo and Indonesia's bapakism as examples. Compadrazgo, a Spanish word that literally translates to ""co-fatherhood"", is based on a kinship ritual that is formed after a child gets baptized into the Roman Catholic faith. For the predominantly Catholic and close-knit Philippine society, the godfather (known as the padrino) is part of one's extended family and is expected to help and protect his godchild. The godchild is expected to respect and be loyal to the padrino. Bapakism is derived from the Indonesian word for ""father"". When used in Indonesian business, bapakism demands great respect and obedience to one's superior. The manager in his role as the company's bapak is expected to look after and care for his employees. Although Asian values are steeped in an ancient culture and tradition, it was only in the 1990s that this concept drew global attention. This was partly due to Asian leaders like the late Singaporean prime minister Lee Kuan Yew's and current Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's championing of Asian values as the ideal way to govern their countries. Lee and Mahathir maintained that in Asia, social order and strong governance are keys to a stable and wealthy society. This type of governance succeeded in fostering rapid growth in Singapore, Malaysia, South Korea and China. Santarita said strong Asian leaders are effective because they serve their constituents and value mutual respect and discipline. Analysts said the Asian emphasis on community and harmony can help resolve some of the world's most pressing international issues such as territorial disputes, climate change and sustainable economic development. Santarita cited the current dispute over the South China Sea which sometimes strains relations between nations. He said the claimants can opt to work together to develop and share resources offered by the South China Sea's blue economy. ""Learning to work together in an orderly, high trust level, and supported by diverse interest groups will prevent conflicts among stakeholders in the South China Sea,"" Santarita said. He said Asia's emphasis on ""respect for authority, respect for the environment and the discipline to control the use of resources"" will also see Asian leaders pursuing a more eco-friendly development path and honor their commitments to the Paris climate agreement.",2019-05-13 07:14,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201905/13/WS5cd8a8c5a3104842260bb2c2.html,chinese,South China Sea dispute
7,EnglishZhongGuoRiBao-2019-05-11 10:53-7,          Military: US report distorts China's strategic intentions        ,"The Chinese military resolutely opposes the Pentagon's new report on China's military development, calling the annual report inaccurate and irresponsible, and stating that it distorted China's strategic intentions, a spokesman for the Ministry of National Defense said late on Thursday night. The US Defense Department claimed in the report delivered to the US Congress that the Chinese military has been stealing defense secrets from the US, and it is being more aggressive in the South China Sea and the Taiwan Straits. The People's Liberation Army might also build new military bases around the world to expand its military presence, it claimed. Senior Colonel Ren Guoqiang, a spokesman of the Chinese Defense Ministry, slammed the report's claims, calling them irresponsible and contradictory of the facts. Ren said the report distorted China's strategic intentions, and recklessly commented on China's rightful military development and necessary actions to protect its sovereignty and security interests. ""The Chinese military resolutely oppose these claims,"" he said. The US has been publishing the annual reportï¼Military and Security Developments Involving the People's Republic of Chinaï¼since 2000, and ""it has damaged Sino-US mutual trust, and harmed the atmosphere for developing the two countries' military relations and bilateral ties,"" Ren added. He urged the US side to ""rationally and objectively view China's defense and military construction, stop publishing similar reports and take concrete actions to ensure the stable development of Sino-US military relations and bilateral ties"". As for the report's comments regarding Taiwan, Ren said Taiwan is an inseparable part of China, and ""China's reunification will, and must be, fulfilled"". ""China urges the US side to abide by the one-China policy and the three joint communiques, and properly handle the Taiwan question,"" he said. ""China's military has the will, confidence and ability to protect its national sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as maintain peace and security in the Taiwan Straits."" Regarding the report's comments on the PLA's activities in the South China Sea, Ren said China is peacefully resolving disputes in the region by negotiating directly with related parties. ""Countries in the region have the confidence, wisdom and ability to handle differences, maintain peace and promote prosperity,"" he said. ""On the other hand, the US claims to be safeguarding peace, but is actually bolstering its military presence, and frequently sends warships and aircraft to provoke tension in the South China Sea."" ""These actions have seriously damaged regional peace and security, as well as the security interests of countries in the region,"" he said. When commenting on the US' recent joint military drill with Japan, India, and the Philippines in the South China Sea, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said on Thursday that the actions and policies of related parties should ""support peace, stability and development in the region, not be against it"".",2019-05-11 10:53,https://africa.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201905/11/WS5cd6393da3104842260bb165.html,chinese,South China Sea dispute

Although that welcome was conditional - reserved for investments that are ""transparent"", and ""reflect economic interests, not national security interests"", as he told the Arctic Council meeting in Rovaniemi, Finland.  At least he showed some deference to the jurisprudential fact that no existing international convention applicable to the Arctic supports preventing any country from benefiting from development of the Arctic.  Some parts of the Arctic Ocean form part of the high seas and international seabed area. This means non-Arctic nations enjoy extensive rights in scientific research, navigation, overflight, fishing, laying of submarine cables and pipelines as well as resource exploration and exploitation in these areas.  As a signatory to the 1925 Spitsbergen Treaty, a member of the International Arctic Science Committee, and accredited observer to the Arctic Council, China has high stakes in Arctic affairs. The emerging Arctic shipping channel, which may dramatically cut sailing time between the Pacific and Atlantic, for one, will prove a significant cost-cutter for Chinese foreign trade. Not to mention the country's special commitment to Arctic peace as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.  Unfortunately, Pompeo's display of sensibleness proved ephemeral, as soon as his fixation on China took over.  ""Do we want the Arctic Ocean to transform into a new South China Sea, fraught with militarization and competing territorial claims?"" he asked his audience, while throwing Washington's hat in that ring with his assertion that the US is strengthening its force presence in the region.  As the white paper China issued in 2018 indicates, nothing it pursues in the Arctic is beyond what it is entitled to under the existing international legal framework. And its participation would be under principles of ""respect, cooperation, win-win result and sustainability"".  If Washington is worried about territorial claims in the Arctic, it should turn to other Arctic Council members.  And it should rest assured that no matter how Beijing defines its relationship with the Arctic, ""near-Arctic"" or not, it will never be a party in any Arctic territorial dispute.  The Pentagon is to present a new defense strategy for the Arctic by June 1. If the past is any guide to the future it will merely continue the pattern of aggressive behavior the US has shown elsewhere, including in the South China Sea.

10,EnglishZhongGuoRiBao-2019-04-30 08:20-10,Awakening of sleeping giant,"Former US congressman Don Bonker recalls his trip to China in the late 1970s, Charlene Cai reports in Washington. Five years into representing the state of Washington in the US Congress in the late 1970s, Don Bonker got a rare treat: a visit to China, a country once regarded by the United States as the ""red enemy"" and eventually considered its new friend. Bonker landed in China on the official US Air Force plane in April 1980-less than one and half years after the two countries established diplomatic relations in January 1979-along with five other congressmen from committees that oversaw the bilateral relationship. The delegation, believed to be the first to visit China since the normalization of relations, was organized by the House Foreign Affairs Committee, according to Bonker, who at the time chaired the Subcommittee on International Economic Policy and Trade. Now in his early 80s, Bonker still remembers what China looked like then. ""The US-China normalization of relations was an eye-opener. We had knowledge of China's glorious history but were stunned by what we witnessed in each of the cities we visited, Beijing, Shanghai and Hangzhou. On the streets, no vehicles, and people mostly wore masks, probably due to pollution. There were no prominent hotels or restaurants,"" says Bonker. Bonker's wife, Carolyn, who accompanied him on the trip, still keeps the bilingual pamphlet from where they stayed in Shanghai, the Jin Jiang Hotel, then the best in the city, and the elaborately decorated bilingual menu from a banquet hosted by then Shanghai mayor. Although China at the time looked gray and backward with bicycles everywhere and facilities in dire condition, everyone on the trip could feel there was something powerful just waiting to be unleashed, Bonker says. ""You could just tell."" A nation of the size and a population of that scale, with the ""cultural revolution"" (1966-76) behind it, was bound to restore itself to the greatness it once had, he adds. The spirit of the Chinese people has stayed in his memory. Sitting in a bus stuck in traffic along the famous Bund road of Shanghai, Bonker and the delegation found that they were suddenly surrounded by thousands of Chinese people, most of whom had rarely seen foreigners, staring at them. They were all in military-like attire, looking curious but cautious. Suddenly, Charles Vanik, the then chair of the powerful House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Trade, opened the bus window and started singing the popular song from the Disney movie Song of the South: ""Zip-a-dee-doo-dah, zip-a-dee-ay, my, oh, my, what a wonderful day."" Everyone on the bus joined in, singing along. Then the magic happened. ""We witnessed a sea of smiles that spread throughout the crowd. It was a delightful few minutes, as smiles replaced the otherwise grim faces,"" recalls Bonker. In a heavy album of their China trip, there is a photo that Bonker likes the most: a child asleep on the shoulder of an adult, a scene they captured on a street. His wife wrote a caption under it: ""China is truly a sleeping giant awakening."" Bonker says, ""My wife really had the vision to predict China's future."" The couple experienced one ""awakening"" of China firsthand. While taking a stroll in Shanghai, the delegation was approached by a young man, who invited the group to his parents' small apartment for dinner. A few years later, as China was opening up to the world, the same young man came to the American University in Washington to study and was welcomed as a regular guest at the Bonkers' apartment on many occasions. ""We treated him like our family. He was very committed to his education here,"" says Bonker. In 2018, Bonker returned to Shanghai as a member of a delegation organized by the US Association of Former Members of Congress. That same young man, David Jin, former CEO of Philips Healthcare China and now chairman and president of Harman International, hosted the group in one of the most prestigious business clubs in Shanghai, a city that had completely transformed from the one Bonker had visited 38 years earlier. Another former US congressman, Tim Roemer of Indiana, was also in the delegation. ""He murmured to me, 'Don, I feel like I am in New York',"" recalls Bonker. After leaving Congress in 1989, Bonker founded the nonprofit International Management and Development Institute, promoting collaborations between the US and European nations. He also served as an executive for APCO Worldwide, a public relations firm that has established itself in China, serving top Chinese companies and helping the Bonkers visit China from time to time. ""What's amazing is the growth of private sector companies, many now leaders in the global economy. Even SOEs adhere to market economies and are often more accountable to banks than to ministries. China still embraces communism, but it has entrepreneurial talent that is unmatched in the 21st century,"" says Bonker. While in Congress, he also served on the President's Export Council, authoring significant trade legislation. He has published a book titled America's Trade Crisis. Trade, Bonker says, is his subject and he's been paying particularly close attention to the current trade dispute and negotiations going on between China and the US. ""The US should focus on increasing its exports to China instead of trying to suppress imports from there,"" Bonker says. ""Exports to China have generated numerous jobs in the US and raised the living standard of Americans. Now exports are being hurt significantly by tariffs, which hurt jobs."" He continues: ""Both countries have strong, charismatic leaders, but it is China that is patient and has the long view. The bottom line is China is surpassing the US as the global leader, and for many US government and policy leaders, it is disturbing."" Bonker is working on a new memoir, Dancing to the Capitol, which he hopes will come out in a few months. ""I know the Chinese like the hugely popular TV soap opera House of Cards.

We also welcome the participation of Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres of the United Nations and Managing Director Christine Lagarde of the International Monetary Fund. The Leaders' Roundtable was chaired by President Xi Jinping of the People's Republic of China. 2. We met at a time when the world economy is facing both expanding opportunities and rising challenges, complicated by profound and rapid changes in the world. We reaffirm that strengthening multilateralism remains essential in addressing global challenges. We also believe that an open, inclusive, interconnected, sustainable and people-centered world economy can contribute to prosperity for all. 3. Recalling the Joint Communique of the Leaders' Roundtable of the 1st Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, including the cooperation objectives, principles and measures contained therein, and reaffirming our commitment to the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, we reiterate that promoting peace, development and human rights, mutually-beneficial cooperation, and honoring the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and international law are our common responsibilities; achieving strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth and improving people's quality of life are our common goals; creating a prosperous and peaceful world with shared future is our common aspiration. 4. The ancient Silk Road contributed to the strengthening of the connectivity and the expansion of the world economy in the spirit of promoting peace and cooperation, openness, inclusiveness, equality, mutual learning and mutual benefit. We look forward to restoring and rejuvenating such spirit, through the Belt and Road Initiative and other cooperation frameworks and initiatives. 5. As cooperation partners, we appreciate the progress already made and important opportunities created in the Belt and Road cooperation, especially the outcomes in areas such as development policy synergy, increased infrastructure investment, economic corridors, economic and trade cooperation zones, industrial parks, finance and trade cooperation, innovation and technology, maritime cooperation, business-to-business ties, people-to-people and cultural exchange. Such cooperation explores new sources of growth and offers potential for economic and social development, and contributes to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. 6. Looking into the future, we envisage high-quality Belt and Road cooperation in enhancing connectivity by promoting development policy synergy, infrastructure development, unimpeded trade, financial cooperation and people-to-people bond, thereby enhancing practical cooperation for the well-being of our peoples. In this context, we look forward to more efforts by cooperation partners. ã» Such cooperation will be based on extensive consultation, joint efforts, shared and mutual benefits. We emphasize the importance of the rule of law and equal opportunities for all. We endeavor to move on with policy and project cooperation through voluntary participation and consensus-building, based on common responsibility and outcomes. All states are equal partners for cooperation that respects openness, transparency, inclusiveness and level playing field. We respect sovereignty and territorial integrity of each other and affirm that each country has the right and primary responsibility to define its development strategies in accordance with its national priorities and legislation. ã» Such cooperation will be open, green and clean. We embrace open economy and inclusive, non-discriminatory global market. All interested countries are welcome to join in such cooperation. We underline the importance of promoting green development and addressing the challenges of environmental protection and climate change including by enhancing our cooperation to implement the Paris Agreement. We encourage more efforts in building a culture of integrity and combating corruption. ã» Such cooperation will pursue high standard, people-centered and sustainable development. We will work together in line with our national legislation, regulatory frameworks, international obligations, applicable international norms and standards. We believe that relevant cooperation should be people-centered and conducive to inclusive quality economic growth and broad-based improvement of people's livelihood. We are committed to promoting sustainability in all its dimensions. 7. We start from the conviction that connectivity contributes to boosting growth, economic and social development, trade in goods and services, as well as investment and creating employment opportunities and better communication and exchanges among peoples. In this regard, promoting global partnership on connectivity, based on transparency, openness and inclusiveness, provides an opportunity for all. Today, through such partnership including the Belt and Road Initiative and other cooperation strategies, we resolve to promote international cooperation, at sub-regional, regional and global levels aiming at a brighter shared future and common prosperity. We support a universal, rules-based, open, transparent and non-discriminatory multilateral trading system with WTO at its core. Strengthening Development Policy Synergy 8. To sustain common development, we welcome sound macroeconomic policies, encourage discussions with regard to Sustainable Development Agenda and will work together to enhance macroeconomic policy dialogue at the UN and other multilateral fora, and promote synergies among related development plans and connectivity initiatives based on the progress already made. 9. In this regard, we also emphasize the opportunities arising from the initiatives and cooperation frameworks, including, inter alia, the ACMECS Master Plan (2019-2023), the African Union including Programme for Infrastructure Development in Africa (PIDA), APEC Connectivity Blueprint, the Arab League, Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) including Master Plan on ASEAN Connectivity 2025, ASEAN Smart Cities Network and ASEAN Initiative on Connecting the Connectivities, ASEM Pathfinder Group on Connectivity, BIMP-East ASEAN Growth Area, Central Asian Connectivity, Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC), the Dubai Silk Road Strategy, EU strategy on connecting Europe and Asia, EU-China Connectivity Platform, EU Eastern Partnership, Eurasian Economic Union, Eurasian partnership, Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC), Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS), Global Infrastructure Connectivity Alliance, International G-Global Project, Lancang-Mekong Cooperation, Organization of American States, Pacific Alliance, Pacific Islands Forum, Union for the Mediterranean and those sub-regional and regional cooperation initiatives between all partners. 10. Determined to pursue trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, we aspire to further open our markets, reject protectionism, unilateralism and other measures that are incompatible with WTO rules. We highlight the importance of special and differential treatment in accordance with WTO agreements. 11. We recognize the importance of improving customs facilitation including by encouraging better cooperation and coordination of relevant agencies involved in border clearance, mutual assistance, information sharing and cooperation, streamlining customs and transit procedures. We encourage such facilitation to be consistent with the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement and accompanied by efficient and effective controls to, inter alia, prevent illicit trade and fight fraud. 12. We call for strengthened cooperation on foreign direct investment and joint ventures in the context of our national laws and international commitments, and encourage an enabling and predictable environment for the promotion of investment and new business opportunities. 13. We intend to enhance cooperation in tax matters, encourage more agreements on avoidance of double taxation, and promote growth-friendly tax policies. To achieve these goals, we aim to work within existing international taxation cooperation frameworks. 14. We endeavor to forge inclusive and diversified global value chains, beneficial to all partners. We encourage greater cooperation on innovation, while protecting intellectual property rights. We also encourage the introduction of digital transport accompanying documents.",2019-04-28 08:55,https://africa.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201904/28/WS5cc4fa20a3104842260b8cf7.html,chinese,South China Sea dispute

13,EnglishZhongGuoRiBao-2019-04-22 20:46-13,PLA Navy's 70th birthday shows how far it has come: China Daily editorial,"The Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy turned 70 on Tuesday. It is a time for reflecting on its beginning and how over the past seven decades it has overcome numerous difficulties to grow into a modern naval force. It is also a time when the country's resolve to build the PLA Navy into a world-class force can be consolidated. As a major Pacific country that has more than 18,000 kilometers of coastlines, China needs a capable naval force that can timely and effectively respond to challenges and risks, especially now it is opening its door wider to the outside world.Â  The PLA Navy is increasingly being looked upon as an indispensable force to defend the country's interests and protect its nationals' personal safety and property overseas. Hence, the calls for China to build a blue-sea navy have become stronger, and the PLA Navy has apparently accelerated its modernization steps in a bid to enhance its combat capabilities and combat readiness. Not to mention that the navy also feels obliged to more effectively respond to challenges to the country's maritime interests and territorial integrity. Apart from the South China Sea and East China Sea disputes in recent years, in which China has seen its maritime interests being encroached upon by neighboring countries, pro-independence forces in Taiwan also pose a threat to the country's territorial integrity.Â  Against such a backdrop, the PLA Navy has to play a more active role in maintaining a high degree of alertness to these, especially as some countries from outside the region have more than once usurped the regional disputes as a way to fish for their own interests, and even staged frequent strategic maneuvers in an attempt to contain China's development momentum. However, as part of China's defense forces, the PLA Navy is ultimately a force for peaceful purposes. The anti-piracy vessels dispatched by the Chinese navy have escorted more than 6,600 vessels in the Gulf of Aden and waters off Somalia since their first escort mission in December 2008. The PLA Navy has also actively participated in international humanitarian missions and conducted various exchanges with naval forces from other countries in a bid to build mutual understanding and deepen strategic mutual trust. The multinational naval activities to mark the PLA Navy's 70th anniversary are also an occasion for further exchanges with the attending navies.",2019-04-22 20:46,https://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201904/22/WS5cbdb78ea3104842260b79ae.html,chinese,South China Sea dispute
14,EnglishZhongGuoRiBao-2019-04-19 22:42-14,          Don Bonker: Longtime hand in US-China trade        ,"Editor's Note: ""My China Album"", a story-sharing project run by the Chinese embassy in Washington and China Daily, aims at highlighting the friendships between Chinese and American people, as expressed in photographs and accompanying captions. Those interested in participating in the program are invited to submit up to three photos with accompanying captions of 300 words or less, explaining the person-to-person exchange or relationship depicted in the photo. The deadline for submissions is April 19, 2019. For more details visit http://global.chinadaily.com.cn/mychinaalbum. Five years into representing the state of Washington in the US Congress in the late '70s, Don Bonker got a rare treat: a visit to China, a country once regarded by the United States as the ""red enemy"" and eventually considered its new friend. Bonker landed in China on the official US Air Force plane in April 1980 â less than one and half years after the two countries established diplomatic relations in January 1979 â along with five other congressmen from committees that oversaw the bilateral relationship. The delegation, presumably the first to visit China since normalization, was organized by the House Foreign Affairs Committee, according to Bonker, who at the time chaired the Subcommittee on International Economic Policy and Trade. Now in his early 80s, Bonker still vividly remembers what China looked like then. ""The USâChina normalization of relations was an eye-opener. We had knowledge of China's glorious history but were stunned by what we witnessed in each of the cities we visited, Beijing, Shanghai and Hangzhou. On the streets, no vehicles, and people mostly wore masks, probably due to pollution. There were no prominent hotels or restaurants,"" said Bonker. Bonker's wife, Carolyn, who accompanied him on the trip, still keeps the bi-lingual pamphlet from where they stayed in Shanghai, the Jin Jiang Hotel, the best in the city, and the elaborately decorated bi-lingual menu from a banquet hosted by Shanghai's mayor. Although China at that time looked gray and backward with bicycles everywhere and facilities in dire condition, everyone in the trip could feel there was something powerful just waiting to be unleashed, Bonker said. ""You could just tell. A nation of this size, a population of this scale, now with the cultural revolution (1966-1976) behind it, was bound to reborn itself to the greatness it once had,"" said Bonker. The spirit of the Chinese people also has stayed in Bonker's memory. Sitting in a bus stuck in traffic along the famous harbor road of Shanghai, Bonker and the delegation found that they were suddenly surrounded by thousands of staring Chinese, most of whom had rarely seen foreigners. They were all in military-like attire, looking curious but cautious. Suddenly, Charles Vanik, chair of the powerful House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Trade, opened the bus window and started singing the popular song from the Disney movie Song of the South: ""Zip-a-dee-doo-dah, zip-a-dee-ay, My, oh, my, what a wonderful dayâ¦"". Everyone in the bus joined in singing along. Then magic happened. ""We witnessed a sea of smiles that spread throughout the crowd. It was a delightful few minutes, as smiles replaced the otherwise grim faces,"" recalled Bonker. In the heavy album of their China trip, there is one photo Bonker likes most. It is a child asleep on the shoulder of an adult, a scene they captured on street. Carolyn wrote a caption under the photo: ""China is truly a sleeping giant awakening."" ""My wife really had the vision to predict China's future,"" said Bonker proudly. The Bonkers experienced one ""awakening"" of China firsthand. While taking a stroll in Shanghai, the delegation was approached by a young man, who invited the group to his parents' small apartment for dinner. A few years later, as China was opening up to the world, the same young man came to American University in Washington to study, becoming a welcomed guest at the Bonker's apartment on many holiday occasions. ""We treated him like our family. He was very committed to his education here,"" said Bonker. In 2018, Bonker returned to Shanghai as a member of a delegation organized by the US Association of Former Members of Congress. That same young man, David Jin, former CEO of Philips Healthcare China and now chairman and president of Harman International, a Fortune 500 company, hosted the group in one of the most prestigious business clubs in Shanghai, a city that had completely transformed itself from the one that Bonker had visited 38 years earlier. Another former US congressman, Tim Roemer of Indiana, was also in the delegation. ""He murmured to me, 'Don, I feel like I am in New York',"" recalled Bonker. After leaving Congress in 1989, Bonker founded non-profit organization International Management and Development Institute, promoting collaborations between the US and European nations. He also served as an executive for APCO Worldwide, a public relations firm that has established itself well in China, serving leading Chinese companies and bringing Bonkers back to China from time to time. ""What's amazing is the growth of private sector companies, many now leaders in the global economy. Even SOE's adhere to market economies and are often more accountable to banks than to ministries. China still embraces Communism, but it has entrepreneurial talent that is unmatched in the 21st century,"" said Bonker. While in Congress, Bonker also served on the President's Export Council, authoring significant trade legislation. He also published a book titled America's Trade Crisis. Trade, Bonker says, is his subject and he's been paying particularly close attention to the current trade dispute and negotiations going on between China and the US. ""The US should focus on increasing its exports to China instead of trying to suppress imports from there,"" Bonker said. ""Exports to China have generated numerous jobs in the US and raised the living standard of Americans. Now exports are being hurt significantly by tariffs, which hurt jobs. ""The bottom-line is China is surpassing the US as the global leader, and for many US government and policy leaders, it is disturbing,"" he added. Bonker is working on a new memoir, Dancing to the Capitol, which he hopes will come out in a few months.",2019-04-19 22:42,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201904/19/WS5cb9de4ea3104842260b740a.html,chinese,South China Sea dispute

Thus they reaffirmed their commitment to the Iran nuclear deal, a key element of the global nonproliferation architecture, and the implementation of the Paris Agreement on climate change, both of which the United States has withdrawn from, believing they do not serve its interests, even though that was never their exclusive purpose.  And unlike the US which it seems does not want to see any tangible outcome in the negotiations between China and the ASEAN countries on a Code of Conduct for the South China Sea, the EU welcomes the talks and hopes they will produce an effective conclusion.  By affirming that they will pursue policies that support an open, balanced, and inclusive global economy and multilateral trading system with the World Trade Organization at its core and better global governance under the United Nations framework, the joint statement showed that China and the EU have a fruitful partnership and recognize their responsibility to lead by example and oppose the damaging tendencies of unilateralism and protectionism.

17,EnglishZhongGuoRiBao-2019-04-10 07:40-17,Report: More disputes likely over South China Sea issues,"New think tank at Peking University offers perspective on resolving dispute China will likely face more disputes when pushing for progress in negotiations and cooperation regarding the South China Sea, according to new situation report released on Tuesday. The report suggests China should enhance maritime strategic dialogue with the United States, closely monitor subtle moves by some ASEAN countries and persuade extra-regional powers such as Japan, Australia and the United Kingdom to help ease tensions in the region. The South China Sea Situation Report was published by the South China Sea Strategic Situation Probing Initiative, a think tank under Peking University's Institute of Ocean Research. The initiative was launched on Tuesday to provide data services and situation analysis about the region. Hu Bo, director of the Center for Maritime Strategy Studies at Peking University, said the overall situation in the South China Sea has eased in recent years, and joint development and maritime cooperation have made solid progress in fields such as fisheries, petroleum, gas and defense. ""However, conflicts and barriers begin to surface as the negotiating sides move from consensus to discussing specific details, such as drawing a territorial boundary,"" said Hu, one of the authors of the report. For example, fishery resources are very mobile, so how to build a multilateral fishery cooperation mechanism to regulate production and conservation in the region will be challenging, he said. Oil and gas development can be even more sensitive because whichever country controls these resources will greatly bolster its economic presence in the region, Hu said. ""Therefore, a preferable way is to steadily push for cooperation with bilateral participation."" Complicating matters, he said, the US has increased its military presence in the South China Sea in recent years under the so-called freedom of navigation operations. But Hu said he believes the focal issue of China-US contention is more about geopolitical competition than it is about sovereignty and freedom of navigation. ""The US is very anxious about China's growing naval capability and continues to wrongfully perceive it as a threat to US military dominance and a means to control the South China Sea,"" he said. ""It is imperative that China and the US enhance the quality of maritime strategic dialogue on substantive issues, including arms control, power structures and rules for military operations."" Hu said China has exercised restraint in handling the South China Sea issue. ""China and the US should learn to coexist with each other in the South China Sea,"" he added. Liu Lin, a researcher on foreign military at the People's Liberation Army Academy of Military Science, said some ASEAN countries are trying to protect their maritime interests via military buildup and resource development in the region, as well as by attracting foreign countries to play a part in the South China Sea situation. ""China will not change its fundamental relationship with ASEAN countries,"" she said. ""But as the negotiation for the code of conduct continues, it will inevitably touch some sensitive and complex issues, and new conflicts might occur if these issues are not handled properly."" Tang Pei, associate researcher at the PLA Naval Research Academy, said a handful of foreign countries are increasingly interested in stirring up tensions in the South China Sea, and their methods are becoming more sophisticated.",2019-04-10 07:40,https://africa.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201904/10/WS5cad2d69a3104842260b5471.html,chinese,South China Sea dispute

21,EnglishZhongGuoRiBao-2019-03-21 06:37-21,          The Daily Telegraph publishes a signed article by ambassador Liu Xiaoming        ,"On March 20, 2019, the Daily Telegraph and its website published a signed article by Ambassador Liu Xiaoming entitled 'Gunboat diplomacy' does not promote peace. The full text is as follows: Asserting their nation's right to freedom of navigation has long been an excuse for certain Western politicians to flex their military muscles by sending naval vessels to the South China Sea. I want to set the record straight on three key issues about the sea in the hope that such behaviour will end. First, freedom of navigation in the South China Sea is already protected under international law. Every year, more than 100,000 merchant vessels, which between them account for one third of the world's seaborne trade, pass through the South China Sea. Never has any single one of them been interrupted or impeded. For China, the world's largest trader in goods in 2018 (with trade valuing $4.62 trillion) and a key trading partner for more than 130 countries and regions in the world, the South China Sea is the route taken by more than 60 per cent of its seaborne trade. The majority of the goods traded between the UK and China, which last year topped $80âbillion for the first time, were shipped through the South China Sea. What's more, 85 per cent of our energy imports also pass through it. There can be no doubt that the South China Sea has the world's busiest, safest and freest shipping lanes.Those who keep calling ""freedom of navigation"" in the South China Sea an issue are therefore, as a Chinese adage so aptly describes, ""worrying about troubles of their own imagination"". Second, the situation in the South China Sea is not as unstable as is often claimed. Yes, there are disputes over territorial sovereignty, maritime rights, and interests which involve complicated elements of history, law, politics and even national sentiments. But, the only way to a proper settlement is through negotiation and consultation on the basis of the free will and sovereign equality of the parties concerned. That is exactly what we and other nations have been working towards. Over the years, China and members of the Association of the Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have been working actively to address the South China Sea issue. Together we signed the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC) in 2002. Since then we have conducted vigorous negotiations on the Code of Conduct in the South China Sea (COC) which resulted in a single draft text of the COC, the first reading of which will have been completed by the end of this year. The parties have also agreed on China's proposal to complete COC negotiations within three years. The relevant disputes have not affected the development of bilateral relations between China and other states in the region. Rather, they have prompted the parties to sit down together and discuss plans to achieve stability and safeguard peace. The most recent example was President Xi Jinping's successful state visit to the Philippines, during which China and the Philippines reached a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on future co-operation on oil and gas development in the area. All these show that the countries surrounding the South China Sea have the confidence, capability and wisdom to deal with their differences properly and maintain steady progress towards improving the situation. Which brings me to my third point, the behaviour of other countries who choose to send warships on so-called ""freedom of navigation"" operations. The South China Sea is more than three million square kilometres in area and has numerous shipping lanes. However, some still choose to steer their navy warships close to the waters adjacent to China's islands and reefs. Some even illegally enter China's territorial waters. These moves flagrantly infringe upon China's sovereignty and maritime rights, deliberately drive a wedge between China and its neighbours, and exacerbate regional tensions. If these acts of gunboat diplomacy, motivated by a Cold War mentality, are not deliberate attempts to stir up trouble then I don't know what is. The world must say no to these hegemonic actions. How can we possibly have international justice and order if a country is free to run amok on another's doorstep just because it has a few ocean-going warships? ""Freedom of navigation"" is not a licence to do whatever one wants. The South China Sea needs peace rather than conflict, stability rather than turbulence. It serves the interests of not only countries in the region but also all the countries in the world. That is why it is vital that countries outside the region come to recognise how important this is to all people, and contribute to the peace and stability of the South China Sea, rather than doing the opposite.",2019-03-21 06:37,https://africa.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201903/21/WS5c92c091a3104842260b1aca.html,chinese,South China Sea dispute

25,EnglishZhongGuoRiBao-2019-01-15 08:00-25,Poor global outlook won't affect economy,"In terms of real economic performance, the year 2018 was ""terrible"" for the world. While it will take some time for the countries to publish their GDP, trade and other economic data for 2018, some major economies are expected to maintain positive growth. But the extremely volatile stock markets worldwide can be taken as a ""barometer"" of the world economy, and it shows that investors suffered huge losses.  Besides, the rise in primary commodities' prices, represented by oil in the first three quarters of 2018, has dealt a blow to consumers. In particular, because of the volatility of the stock markets - from China to the US to other major economies - the total market value loss last year could reach up to $20 trillion.  Stock market turmoil to hurt real economy  The FTSE All-World Index, which tracks thousands of stocks across markets, was down 12 percent last year - its worst performance since the 2008 subprime crisis which led to the global financial crisis - in stark contrast to the nearly 25 percent gain in 2017. The turmoil in the stock markets has not yet caused the GDP of major economies to shrink, but given the central role of finance in the modern economic system, a plummeting stock market will gradually start hurting the real economic sector.  Worse, as the world's two largest economies, China and the United States both saw a dip in their economic activity indexes in December.  China's Purchasing Managers' Index for the manufacturing sector averaged 50.9 percent last year, indicating overall growth of the sector for whole year. However, the PMI fell below 50 percent, the threshold between expansion and contraction, to 49.4 percent in December for the first time since July 2016. The US Dallas Fed Mfg Business Index, which assesses the Texas state factory activity, too, fell to minus 5.1 in December, the biggest drop since 2013.  Since the combined nominal GDP of the US and China accounted for 39.2 percent of the world total in 2017 and their contribution to global economic growth reached 57.6 percent in 2016, the cooling of economic activity in the two countries at the end of 2018 will inevitably affect other economies around the world.  Bearish mid-term outlook for 2019  In the face of cooling global trade and financial market volatility in 2018, especially in the second half of the year, international economic bodies and commercial financial institutions have successively lowered their forecast for world economic and trade growth for 2018 and 2019. And their outlook for medium-and long-term economic development is bearish. For example, Japan's Nomura Research Institute said the global economy has entered an irreversible downward path. In a mid-2018 report, the World Bank, too, said the world economy could be in a ""dark decade"" of low growth and high systemic risk starting from 2019.  So, is the world economy really headed for a period of low growth, even recession?  The poor global economic performance and stock market volatility in 2018 can be attributed to some intrinsic factors, such as the aftermath of quantitative easing and other abnormal monetary policies implemented by major central banks after the subprime crisis. But the rise of protectionism and a series of trade disputes the US has triggered against major economies, including China, have caused a lot of trouble for global trade.  Still, given that the US could suffer another financial crisis and its real economic sector could again plunge into depression, the global economic and trade outlook for this year is not optimistic. Especially, because despite facing a possible financial crisis, even depression, neither the US nor European countries, nor emerging market economies have taken countermeasures. Making matters worse are some political problems that pose a risk to the global economy this year and could even escalate into a crisis endangering peace and stability in the world.  US actions pose a risk to global economy  China and the US have reached a consensus not to impose higher tariffs on each other's imports for 90 days pending an outcome in bilateral trade negotiations. But due to the US' increasing protectionist inclination, it is still unclear whether the two countries can reach a long-term accord and prevent a trade war - not least because the US administration seems hell-bent on violating all existing agreements. The US is also creating trouble by refusing to approve new judges to the World Trade Organization's appellate body after its two judges' terms ends this year, which risks leaving the WTO essentially paralyzed.  More worryingly, some forces in the US are intent on pushing Sino-US relations toward confrontation. In a speech delivered at Hudson Institute on Oct 4, US Vice-President Mike Pence accused China of ""meddling in America's democracy"", and criticized China's ""militarization"" of disputed areas in the South and East China seas, and its practice of ""debt diplomacy"" in developing countries. Pence's remarks reminded one of the Cold War days.  And on Dec 31, Trump signed a bill proposed by some anti-Beijing senators that allows the US to sell more arms to Taiwan and encourage senior US officials to visit the island, casting a shadow on Sino-US relations as well as the situation across the Taiwan Straits.  China has consistently shown its sincerity and made maximum efforts to avoid the ""Thucydides trap"". But whether the US will respond in kind does not depend on China's efforts alone. The world economy faces a gloomy prospect, but that does not mean there is no hope of an upturn.  Stabilizing role in world economy  First, China's centralized and unified leadership has been adopting effective measures to stabilize growth, in order to boost the economy and prevent it from hitting the bottom. The past decade has shown that the Chinese economy is no longer just the ""economic stabilizer"" of East Asia; it is also a powerful ""engine"" driving the world economy. Based on the value of the dollar in 2015, China's contribution to world economic growth was 41.3 percent in 2016, compared with 16.3 percent of the US and 1.4 percent of Japan. Needless to say, the steady growth of China's contribution to global economic growth has played a stabilizing role in the world economy.  Second, the nearly 70 years of New China's history shows the country has the capacity to turn a crisis into an opportunity for further reform. In its 40 years of reform and opening-up, China has faced many external shocks - from the global debt crisis in the early 1980s and the 1997-98 East Asian financial crisis to the 2008 global financial crisis. And it has turned each one of those crises into an opportunity to raise its status in the international economic system.  Still, the unprecedented challenges facing the global multilateral trading system represented by the WTO may create new challenges for China's economic development. However, a series of preemptive measures that China has taken, such as the Belt and Road Initiative, is expected to offset the negative impacts of an external crisis on the Chinese economy and, instead, promote its further development through closer economic and infrastructure connectivity with a number of countries across the world.  The author is a researcher at the International Trade and Economic Cooperation Institute of the Ministry of Commerce.

Wang will also meet with Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the forum, and exchange views with participants from various fields, Lu said. ""China is firmly confident that its economic fundamentals will remain sound in the long term and the Chinese economy will keep growing at mid and high speed toward becoming a medium and high-end economy,"" Lu said at a regular news conference in Beijing. In response to some pessimistic expectations on the Chinese economy, Lu noted that the general steady growth trend remains unchanged. ""Despite some uncertainties and destabilizing factors from the outside environment, China's development has full tenacity and huge potential,"" he said. Beijing protests Xisha incursion of US warship In another development, China lodged solemn representations with the United States for a US Navy warship trespassing on Monday into China's territorial waters off the Xisha Islands in the South China Sea. ""China immediately sent military vessels and aircraft to identify and verify the US warship in accordance with the law, and to warn it off,"" Lu said. The operation violated Chinese and related international laws, severely undermined China's sovereignty and jeopardized the peace, security and good order in those waters, he said. ""China firmly opposes the US action and urges it to immediately stop such provocation,"" he said, adding that China will continue to take necessary measures to safeguard its sovereignty and security. The guided-missile destroyer USS McCampbell sailed within 12 nautical miles of the Xisha Islands on Monday, the same day that the first round of face-to-face trade talks between Beijing and Washington got underway in Beijing after President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Donald Trump reached an agreement in Argentina on Dec 1.

29,EnglishZhongGuoRiBao-2019-01-03 20:21-29,It would be great if Britain could step out of the past: China Daily editorial,"Given its coming divorce from the European Union and its desire to show it is its own master, Britain seems to feel the need to demonstrate that its status is not dependent on it being part of the European collective. But its intended means of displaying its glorious independence in Southeast Asia will only mark it out as a troublemaker. British Secretary of State for Defence Gavin Williamson in an interview with The Sunday Telegraph last week, said Britain would open two new military bases in ""a couple of years"", one in the Caribbean and the other in Southeast Asia with Singapore and Brunei as possible sites. This would unnecessarily break the current strategic equilibrium in the Asia-Pacific and fuel new tensions at the geopolitical level. To be charitable, since Britain is hoping for a trade deal with the United States to keep its economy afloat after it severs its advantageous ties with its European partners, the move is perhaps one of desperation rather than malice. In recent years, Washington has used the regional maritime disputes as an excuse to meddle in regional affairs and a means to create discord, and it has been pressuring its allies to do the same. London will be keen to show it's willing to do so while holding out its cap for pennies. US President Donald Trump's announcement that Washington would stop playing the self-assumed role as a ""world policeman"" had raised hopes that the US would stop interfering in others' affairs. So Britain's plan to beef up its military presence in the region has naturally led people to think that London, unsatisfied with its previous role as Washington's deputy sheriff, may seek to polish its prestige by claiming the tin star that the US seems to be discarding. While that is beyond its capabilities, London as Washington's loyal follower has always been willing to do Washington's bidding, so there is no reason to think the new base will not do the same. To project its power through naval muscle-flexing is a residual of Britain's days of empire when it sent gunboats to convince others that homage was in order. Those days are past. It is no longer a time when outside forces can impose their will on the region. With the mutual efforts of China and the members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the maritime disputes have not hindered efforts to enhance cooperation in the region.",2019-01-03 20:21,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201901/03/WS5c2dfe54a31068606745ec4c.html,chinese,South China Sea dispute
30,EnglishZhongGuoRiBao-2018-12-26 08:07-30,Global security faces severe challenges,"The international security situation this year has been as complicated as ever. The rise of unilateralism and protectionism along with nationalism and populism, the resurgence of strong-arm politics, intensified geopolitical competitions, and incessant regional turbulence and conflicts all pose serious challenges to the global security order and rules. Compared with previous years, the highlight of international security this year is China's warmer relations with neighbors, with the turmoil in the Middle East being the hotspot issue and the Sino-US trade conflict the biggest challenge. First, the consensus on managing a crisis to avoid a head-on confrontation remains even though the competition between major countries has intensified. The geopolitical competition among major countries has always been an important barometer of the changes in the international landscape. But now the competition has developed new trends. Concern over expanding geopolitical competition The geopolitical competition has extended to multiple fields, shifting from coordination and cooperation to confrontation and rivalry. But despite the contradictions between China and the US, and between Russia and the US being the major contradictions, non-confrontation and non-conflict continue to be the bottom line in major country relations. Second, even though major countries are focusing more on traditional security, an all-out military confrontation is not likely to happen. The continuous growth in major countries' military budgets, adjustments and arrangements in their military strategies, rapid development of information technology and intelligent weapons, and the United States' withdrawal from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty all show major countries have renewed their focus on traditional security. Which in turn has triggered a new arms race that lays emphasis on winning the information war. But unlike the Cold War, the impact of this arms race can still be managed. Third, there is a notable change in the situation in the usual global hotspots. With the fierce competition among the major powers in key regions more profoundly influencing the developments in hotspot issues, regional situations seem to be swaying from one end to the other. For instance, the US' withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal and re-imposition of comprehensive sanctions on Iran have caused much upheaval in the Middle East. In addition, the unresolved regional and global conflicts are constantly releasing their destructive energy. For example, the European migrant crisis has had a chain reaction on Europe's political, economic and societal development, giving rise to nationalism and populism in a number of European countries, and increasing hate crimes, even turmoil. Also, as the security situation on the Korean Peninsula improves, the Middle East and South Asia face a more complicated and turbulent situation. Fundamental changes in Sino-US relations Fourth, some fundamental changes have occurred in China-US relations, but the possibility of a new Cold War is low. The US has made strategic changes to its China policy, mainly in its understanding of interests, threats and attitude. It has listed China as a major competitor, a revisionist country, a neo-imperialist, a nurturer of State capitalism and an unfair trader. The US also sees China's rise as a structural challenge to its global leadership. Accordingly, US strategies focus on dealing with so-called threats from China and Russia. Which signifies a radical change in the US' policy on China. How to reshape bilateral ties is a challenge both sides have to take up. Fifth, China's relations with neighbors, including India, Japan and member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, have greatly improved, although some hotspot issues could recur such as the Diaoyu Islands dispute, the South China Sea issue and the boundary dispute between China and India. Sixth, the rapid developments in the field of science and technology have had notable beneficial effects as well as adverse impacts on societies. The rapid creation and application of new technologies including artificial intelligence, biotechnology, big data and cloud computing have brought about changes in production methods, and people's thought process and lifestyles. Still, the international community is worried about the negative impact of new technologiesï¼for instance, they could lead to a spiritual, ethical or moral crisis, even political or economic crisis. Nationalism a threat to global security But despite the international order and landscape not undergoing any fundamental or qualitative changes, the pace of quantitative change appears to have gathered speed. Given such a complicated and uncertain international security situation, the international community should attempt to build a consensus on and strengthen global security governance. But since rising nationalism is threatening to shake the foundation of global security governance, giving rise to multiple new challenges, such a consensus seems a distant dream. To begin with, the security governance system is under siege. The US withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal and the INF Treaty has had a big impact on regional and global strategic stability and cast a shadow on the nuclear nonproliferation regime and global nonproliferation efforts. Besides, global security governance has suffered a setback due to major countries expanding their defense budgets and attaching increasing importance to traditional security. In particular, the US administration's ""America first"" policy has weakened the global security governance system and violated the common security values. And to meet their domestic political requirements, some major countries are undermining the global security governance system. For instance, when dealing with nontraditional security threats such as climate change and migrant crisis, some major countries, to fulfill their domestic agenda, have failed to honor their global commitments and thus weakened global security governance. To address the new security challenges, President Xi Jinping has proposed the concept of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security and a path of security featuring consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits, and thus provided a practical and feasible way of maintaining world peace and security. This philosophy, if incorporated in global security governance, will make the world a secure and better place for all countries and peoples.",2018-12-26 08:07,https://europe.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201812/26/WS5c22c635a310d91214050d62.html,chinese,South China Sea dispute
31,EnglishZhongGuoRiBao-2018-12-15 09:01-31,"China wants to be relevant, not dominant","Beijing and the West won't agree on everything, but they have enough in common to recognize that dialogue is the tool to reduce their divergence and move toward greater convergence In 1978, Deng Xiaoping not only changed the destiny of his own country but his vision also modified the course of world history. Over the past four decades, the success of China has changed the life of the Chinese people for the better and created a global geopolitical situation in which the country has clearly regained centrality. In this context, one way to mark the 40th anniversary of Deng's reform and opening-up is to try to answer the major question of our time: will the re-emergence of an ancient non-Western civilization be a disruptive force, or can China and the West design in a genuinely cooperative relationship a new international order? A third trajectory is in fact more probable than these two scenarios. An essentially peaceful coexistence characterized by a mix of disputes, tensions but also negotiated agreements and varying levels of understanding could be the backdrop of Sino-Western relations. Confrontation scenario should not be ignored Despite its low probability, the extreme scenario of a Sino-Western confrontation should not be totally ignored. The West as much as China, albeit for different reasons, could be at the origin of such a sad course of events. In reaction to the ongoing redistribution of power, conservative forces in the West could push for the containment of China with the objective of preserving Western dominance in global affairs. Such a posture caused by the fear of a loss in a zero-sum game representation of the world would create an unnecessarily divided global village and increase the risk of escalation of what would become a US-China strategic rivalry. In the event of China suffering severe and long-lasting economic difficulties, some in China could make use of the nationalistic card to maintain social stability and domestic cohesiveness. But, despite the challenges it faces, the Chinese economy is still growing at more than 6.5 percent a year, while mass entrepreneurship, an innovative spirit and the globalization of Chinese companies indicate that the world's most populous nation has entered a transition from quantitative growth to more qualitative and sustainable development. Moreover, a more nationalistic tone in China would not necessarily mean an aggressive China, for history illustrates that neither militarism nor expansionism has been defining features of the country. If one takes long-term history as a reference, China has never really collapsed; it merely closed itself from its surroundings. In Deng's reform and opening-up, there is the implicit understanding of the risk of isolation. In another possible turn of events, it is China's resurgence which could also be hypothetically at the source of Sino-Western antagonism. However, after what the country remembers as the 100 years of humiliation in the aftermath of the Opium Wars there is no alarming sign of a revengeful political narrative targeting the West or Japan. China did not attribute to others the responsibility for its painful marginalization following the Industrial Revolution; it re-emerged not by putting the blame on external factors but by reforming itself. Deng's emphasis on the notion of reform illustrates this feature. China aware of risks in changing world order In any discussion on the determinants of a logic of Sino-Western opposition, one has to take into consideration the fact that China keeps reaffirming its strategy of peaceful rise. By doing so, Beijing recognizes the risks inherent to any significant rearrangement of power while it displays confidence in its capacity to wisely manage a process of change. China aims to be relevant but not dominant; its quest for centrality should not be mistaken for a martial mobilization for global hegemony or even leadership. If an antagonistic scenario is highly improbable, does it mean that cooperation will define the future of Sino-Western relations? Dealing with a series of crises, the West and China have indeed shown that they can have productive collaboration (UN peacekeeping missions, the fight against nuclear proliferation, the Iran nuclear deal, counter-terrorism, and the Paris climate accord). But while the two sides know how to cooperate when they have identified a common threat, they also differ on the interpretation of a number of security and political issues. NATO and China evolve on separate courses, and even if exchanges are taking place between the two, a cooperative articulation between the Western military alliance and the People's Liberation Army won't materialize in the foreseeable future. While China and Russia are rapidly enriching their strategic partnership, the West has imposed sanctions on Moscow following the Ukraine crisis. A trust deficit already affects Sino-Western interactions in the security domain (neither the United States nor the European Union can sell weapons to China, and the territorial claims in the South China Sea are a source of disagreement) but, in cyberspace, it is strategic mistrust which complicates Sino-US relations. Since 1949 the Chinese and the Western political systems have been operating on different understandings of legitimacy, and while China has been evolving over the past 40 years into governance in which the rule of law is becoming increasingly central, one should not expect the two systems to coincide. Sovereign entity with traits of a unique civilization Fundamentally, China behaves as a sovereign entity which has inherited the characteristics of a unique civilization. The Chinese renaissance of the present is not about an absolute rupture with the past but a balance between new forms of governance and ancient socio-political practices. In a sense, one of the major real-life counter-arguments to Francis Fukuyama's narrative on ""the end of history"" is the Chinese renaissance and its effects on the world system. Modernization, from a Chinese perspective, cannot be synonymous with Westernization. On the spectrum ranging from confrontation to cooperation, from the Huntingtonian ""clash of civilizations"" to ""the end of history"", the nuances and complexities of geopolitical coexistence will most probably mark Sino-Western relations. The West and China won't agree on everything but they have enough in common to recognize that dialogue and negotiation are the instruments to reduce their divergence and enlarge their convergence. In its strategic approach to China, the West has to take into account the fact that through its long history the Middle Kingdom has been through periods of openness to the worldï¼the Tang (618-907) and Song (960-1279) dynasties or the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) of the Yongle Emperorï¼and periods of isolation. The world benefits from an open China (the size of its market, the Chinese creation of economic value across continents, Sino-Western agreements to tackle threatening global issues), but China's periods of greatness were also periods of openness. For the West, but also for Chinese forces of progress, the real danger to avoid is a Chinese return to a solitary course since it would initiate an era of de-globalization as well as abort the promises of the Chinese renaissance. It is in this context that Western political and economic leaders have to act as catalysts for China's opening-up. There are evident interactions between gaige (reform) and kaifang (opening-up), the two main themes of Deng's policy, but it is the level of opening-up which determines the nature and intensity of the reforms. China far removed from complacent isolationism With the new Silk Road initiative, an unprecedented outward looking vision in the Chinese historical context, President Xi Jinping undermined the conservative forces which would prosper in proportion with China's disconnect from the world, and elevated Deng's policy of opening-up while leading the country even further away from complacent isolationism. By suspecting the motives of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, one of the Belt and Road Initiative's international financial support mechanisms, the US misses an opportunity to accompany China in its opening-up. Although it has been more responsive to Xi's diplomatic initiative, the European Union could certainly be more pro-active in the creation of synergies along the Afro-Eurasian axis. In the 1950s, then premier Zhou Enlai put forward the notion of peaceful coexistence. In the 21st century, coexistence between the West and China has not only to be peaceful but can also be mutually transformative. The forms that a mutually transformative coexistence can take are many but the EU is certainly positioned to be an effective catalyst of China's opening-up, while China is potentially a powerful catalyst for more European cohesiveness. EU must enter digital age with renewed ambition The digital revolution is having a big impact on the dynamics of Chinese society, but digital China invites Europe to enter the digital age with a renewed ambition. The potential creation of value of the digital or artificial intelligence technologies is unlimited and, as such, stands as an invitation to go behind zero-sum game approaches and embrace dynamic interdependence. China is at the dawn of a great entrepreneurship revolution. In 2015, about eight private companies were established every minute in the countryï¼12,000 per day. The connection between Western and Chinese private entrepreneurs, which has to be supported and encouraged, guarantees the continuation of China's opening-up and creates new global economic but also social values. Western modernity has positively contributed to the transformation of China, but a metamorphosed and global China can take the world to another level of prosperity and human development. If the notion of peaceful coexistence prevents us from falling into a logic of confrontation, the dynamic concept of a mutually transformative coexistence takes us even closer to a logic of cooperation.",2018-12-15 09:01,https://africa.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201812/15/WS5c145275a3107d4c3a000f57.html,chinese,South China Sea dispute

A perception that US Vice-President Mike Pence fueled with his divisive remarks at the APEC meeting in Papua New Guinea on the weekend. But while that might be the game the US is playing, it is not what China is doing. It would be more to the point to say that Xi is visiting a close neighbor and consolidating the good momentum in relations that has been fostered since Duterte reopened the door to cooperation. Last year, the trade volume between the two countries topped $50 billion, and the newly added investment from China reached $53.84 million, representing a year-on-year increase of 67 percent. But as well as their economic cooperation, they are also making joint efforts to combat illegal drugs and terrorism, and promote people-to-people exchanges. The strong development momentum in China-Philippines ties strikes another positive note in China's neighborhood diplomacy, as well as in its interaction with the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations, at a time when China and the regional bloc are jointly working to advance consultations on the Code of Conduct to maintain peace and stability in the South China Sea. Xi's remarks when he spoke with Duterte in Manila on Tuesday, reinforced his words at the APEC meeting, that China is sincere in wanting to form a community for common development in the region.

39,EnglishZhongGuoRiBao-2018-11-16 09:17-39,Speech by Li Keqiang at the 13th East Asia Summit,"Speech by H.E. Li KeqiangPremier of the State Council of the People's Republic of ChinaAt the 13th East Asia SummitSingapore, 15 November 2018 Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong,Colleagues,It gives me great pleasure to join you in the Lion City. I wish to thank the Singapore Government for its thoughtful arrangements for our Summit. Singapore, one of the most developed countries in Asia, stands as a fine example of mutual cultural convergence between the East and the West by retaining its rich traditional heritage of the East and embracing advanced Western ideas and technologies at the same time. The spirit of openness and inclusiveness that Singapore espouses is also an important feature of the East Asia Summit (EAS), which, over the past 13 years, has become a significant platform for dialogue and cooperation and played a substantial role in enhancing understanding and trust among participating countries and promoting development and prosperity in the region. The international political and economic landscape has been undergoing profound adjustments. Uncertainties and destabilizing factors have been on the increase, from weak global growth, rising unilateralism and protectionism, backlash against economic globalization, to regional hotspots coupled with terrorism and other non-traditional security threats. The pursuit of peace and development remains a daunting task. In such a global context, East Asia has kept overall stability and remained a most robustly growing region and a most attractive investment destination. This has been the result of both the perseverance and enterprise of countries in the region and their joint endeavors to promote mutually beneficial cooperation and seek common ground while shelving differences. Such hard-won accomplishments need to be cherished. With a renewed commitment to amicable co-existence and win-win cooperation, we will step up consultation and dialogue and pursue greater opening-up and progress in East Asia. Together, we will strive to be a vigorous facilitator of peace and stability in East Asia, leading contributor to economic prosperity, and powerful locomotive for regional cooperation. East Asian cooperation has come a long way in recent years. We have seen ASEAN Communities being established, frameworks such ASEAN Plus One, ASEAN Plus Three and Lancang-Mekong cooperation producing fruitful results, and growing momentum of trade and investment and integrated development in the region. EAS participating countries need to seize such precious opportunities to advance cooperation in priority areas and inject fresh impetus to East Asian cooperation. We should maintain the nature of EAS as a ""leaders-led strategic forum"" focusing on East Asia and on development, uphold ASEAN centrality, and advance economic development and political and security cooperation in parallel as the two wheels driving EAS forward. In this connection, I wish to make the following points. First, we need to uphold multilateralism. In today's world where the interests and future of countries are interconnected, only by committing to multilateralism, mutual respect and consultations on an equal footing, playing by the rules and working with one another can we effectively tackle global challenges and promote common development in the region. It was the spirit of solidarity and mutual assistance that helped us overcome the Asian and international financial crises. This same spirit of multilateralism will again be vital to our efforts to prevail over the daunting challenges today. As an advocate for upholding the international order and multilateralism, China calls for the building of a new type of international relations featuring mutual respect, fairness, justice and win-win cooperation and a community with a shared future for mankind. China will work with other countries to safeguard the rules-based international order, unswervingly pursue friendship and cooperation with our East Asian neighbors, and promote security based on rules and development through cooperation. This way, we will do our part for peace and prosperity in the region. Second, we need to promote free trade. Free trade is a vital pillar of the modern economy and bedrock for national development and prosperity. As the global industrial, supply and value chains continue to develop, countries around the world are seeing their economies mutually interlinked and integrated. In such an interdependent relationship, any attempt to close doors and raise barriers will only backfire. Greater market openness and collaboration through division of labor is the right way to achieve win-win results. We need to focus our efforts on building an open world economy, supporting the multilateral trading system centered around the WTO, advance trade and investment liberalization and facilitation and promote steady growth of the world economy. In making necessary adjustments to improve the existing WTO rules, parties should adhere to the general direction of free trade, and see to it that the adjustments will fully accommodate the interests and concerns of all players and help narrow the North-South gap. Third, we need to accelerate regional economic integration. Over the past 70 years and more since the end of the Second World War, Asia has achieved progress and prosperity thanks to economic globalization and opening-up and cooperation among countries in the region. For East Asia to keep its role as a main engine for global growth and realize a higher level of development, economic integration would be a natural choice. Regional free trade arrangements have picked up pace. ASEAN has established the AEC. China, Japan and the ROK have all established free trade areas with ASEAN. China and ASEAN have completed negotiations to upgrade their FTA. Positive steps have been taken in developing an East Asia Economic Community. The RCEP is the biggest free trade agreement in East Asia that meets the development needs of its extensive membership. At this crucial moment, what is needed is political resolve to conclude the negotiations as quickly as possible to deliver early benefits to people and businesses in the region. China holds an open attitude toward the CPTPP and hopes that when effective, it will be conducive to East Asian cooperation and inclusive development. Fourth, we need to advance regional cooperation for sustainable development. Development remains the top priority of East Asian countries, many of whom are developing countries in need of sustained attention to and greater investment in people's wellbeing. This year, China has implemented cooperation projects in such areas as environment and resource management, clean energy, tumor prevention and control and special food. Continued efforts are needed to follow through on the Manila Plan of Action, advance cooperation in the six priority areas, namely, energy, education, finance, public health, environmental protection and disaster management, and ASEAN connectivity. Exchanges and cooperation on food security and poverty reduction need to be stepped up. The Statement on ASEAN Smart Cities co-sponsored by Singapore and China will facilitate innovation cooperation among countries in the region. China will host a new energy forum and a seminar on maritime management next year, and continue to hold the clean energy forum and the seminar on natural resources and information sharing. China further calls for joint studies on geosciences to promote balanced and inclusive development of the region. Fifth, we need to conduct dialogue and cooperation in political and security areas. A safe and stable environment is a prerequisite for development and prosperity in the region. Parties need to increase communication on development strategies and policies to dispel misgivings, reduce misjudgment and enhance political trust. China advocates the vision on common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, supports discussions on regional security outlook and architecture that suits this region, and advocates peaceful settlement of disputes through dialogue and consultation. China will carry out non-traditional security cooperation with parties on counter-terrorism, climate change and cyber security. China supports the statement sponsored by Russia on fighting terrorism and will hold joint counter-terrorism exercises next year to promote peace and tranquility in the region. Colleagues, Major positive changes have taken place on the Korean Peninsula with improved North-South relations and advancement in the dialogue process between the DPRK and the United States. Parties need to seize the opportunities to step up dialogue and consultation, accommodate each other's legitimate concerns, and convert political commitment into concrete actions in order to move toward the goal of complete denuclearization and a peace mechanism and achieve early, lasting peace on the Peninsula. Tranquility in the South China Sea is the aspiration of all parties and serves the interests of countries in this region. China is the biggest littoral state with over 60% of its seaborne trade in goods passing through the South China Sea. China firmly supports the freedom of navigation and overflight pursuant to international law. China is probably more keen than any other country to see peace and stability in the South China Sea. In his seven voyages to Southeast Asia and onward over 600 years ago, the Chinese navigator Zheng He laid the foundations for a tradition of benevolence, neighborliness and peaceful coexistence among Asian countries. Today, the Chinese economy has deeply integrated into the world economy and China and its neighbors live in a closely-knit community with a shared future. China will steadfastly pursue a foreign policy of building friendships and partnerships with its neighbors. We are ready to properly manage the South China Sea issue with countries in this region to turn the South China Sea into a sea of peace, friendship and cooperation. China is committed to working with ASEAN countries to fully and effectively implement the DOC, carry out practical maritime cooperation and actively advance COC consultations. China is sincerely committed to take forward COC consultations. At the China-ASEAN Summit yesterday, all parties agreed to complete the first reading of the single draft negotiating text within 2019. And China and some ASEAN countries put forward a vision of concluding COC consultations in three years' time through the concerted efforts of China and ASEAN countries. By working together, we are confident that China and ASEAN countries will reach a COC that reflects the realities of our region, serves our peoples, and anchors peace, stability and enduring tranquility in the South China Sea. We also hope that non-regional states will respect and support these efforts by regional countries. Colleagues, This year marks the 40th anniversary of China's reform and opening-up. Over the past four decades, China has made remarkable achievements and contributed its share to the development and progress in East Asia and the world beyond. The just-concluded inaugural China International Import Expo fully demonstrated China's sincere desire and voluntary steps to open up its market and share development opportunity with other countries. China will deepen reform comprehensively, advance a new round of high-standard opening-up, and move toward high-quality development. All this will only bring more opportunities to the world. As a Chinese saying goes, ""A single drop of water cannot make an ocean, nor can a single tree form a forest"". China will enhance solidarity and mutual trust and deepen dialogue and cooperation with all countries. Together, let us sustain the sound momentum of prosperity and stability in our region, and build an even brighter future of peace and development for East Asia.",2018-11-16 09:17,https://africa.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201811/16/WS5bee1a9ea310eff3032890d5.html,chinese,South China Sea dispute
40,EnglishZhongGuoRiBao-2018-11-15 21:30-40,Pence's remarks show who the real troublemaker is: China Daily editorial,"In remarks that carried a barely veiled swipe at China, US Vice-President Mike Pence told leaders of Southeast Asian nations in Singapore on Thursday that ""empire and aggression have no place"" in the region. Yet in referring to it as ""the Indo-Pacific"" at a summit of Southeast Asian leaders, he once again showed that is what the United States is bringing to the Asia-Pacific. Yet his bid to pit China against its Asia-Pacific neighbors will find no takers, because it was so out of sync with what the annual Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit and its related meetings were focusing on â enhanced trade, and peace and security in the region. Talks on the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership - which would create the world's largest trade bloc - continued to make progress this week and the negotiations are expected to be concluded next year. And while Pence intimated that China was a hostile presence in the region - a threat to both sovereignty and values - his view was at odds with both the views of leaders in the region and with the reality. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said at the summit that relations between China and its Southeast Asian neighbors were ""excellent"". And despite the maritime territorial disputes that exist between China and some of the ASEAN members, the two sides have agreed to finalize a Code of Conduct in the South China Sea in three years to maintain peace and security in the region. Indeed, the ASEAN meetings in Singapore have highlighted who the real troublemaker is, as, on his way from Tokyo to Singapore, the US vice-president saw fit to conduct a so-called freedom of navigation mission by flying some 30 kilometers from Chinese islands in the South China Sea. These contentious military maneuvers merely create the risk of an incident and serve to show how ubiquitous and provocative the US military presence is in the region even though there is no threat to its interests. If you take away the cause, the effects cease. The US administration's ""America first"" policies are antithetical to the concerted efforts of countries in the region to uphold the common good through greater integration, free trade and dialogue.",2018-11-15 21:30,https://africa.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201811/15/WS5bed74faa310eff303288fa8.html,chinese,South China Sea dispute
41,EnglishZhongGuoRiBao-2018-11-15 09:54-41,          Premier Li's speech at 21st China-ASEAN Summit        ,"Speech by H.E. Li Keqiang Premier of the State Council of the Peopleâs Republic of China At the 21st China-ASEAN Summit Singapore, 14 November 2018 Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, Colleagues, It is a great pleasure to join you in Singapore for the 21st China-ASEAN Summit in Commemoration of the 15th Anniversary of China-ASEAN Strategic Partnership. I wish to thank the Singapore Government for its thoughtful preparations and arrangements for the Summit. In the past 15 years, faced with a complex and changing international and regional situation, Asian countries have maintained overall peace and stability, withstood the test of the global financial crisis, and enjoyed a sound momentum of fast development. We Asian countries have become an important presence on the world stage. The past 15 years have also seen a momentous journey for China-ASEAN relations. In 2003, China became the first country to establish a strategic partnership with ASEAN. The Joint Declaration on China-ASEAN Strategic Partnership for Peace and Prosperity signed by our leaders in Bali marked the beginning of a new historical stage in our fast-growing relations. Over these 15 years, we have engaged in all-round, multi-tiered and wide-ranging cooperation which has delivered bountiful outcomes. We upgraded the 2+7 cooperation framework to the 3+X framework, and achieved a leap in our ties from quantity to quality. China-ASEAN relationship now enjoys tremendous vitality and bright prospects. We enriched the substance of our strategic cooperation. We deepened strategic communication by setting up security dialogue platforms, and worked to build an open and inclusive regional architecture based on international law and rules. This has contributed to the maintenance of overall peace and stability in our region. We established the Lancang-Mekong cooperation framework, worked toward the East Asia economic community, and led the way in the regional integration process. This has boosted regional development and prosperity. We maintained close communication and coordination at APEC, the UN and other fora, worked together to improve the global governance system by reform and resolve regional and international hotspots by peaceful means, and opened new prospects for South-South cooperation. China-ASEAN relations have gone beyond the bilateral scope and gained increasing regional and global significance. We established a framework for win-win cooperation. Since President Xi Jinping set out the vision of a 21st Century Maritime Silk Road in 2013, China and ASEAN countries have reached broad consensus on jointly taking forward the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) with concrete steps for stronger synergy between the BRI and ASEANâs development plans. So far nine ASEAN countries have signed agreements with China on BRI cooperation, which facilitated the delivery of a series of big projects on infrastructure connectivity and industrial capacity cooperation. We established and upgraded the largest FTA among developing countries whereby over 90% of our goods can trade at zero tariff. Two-way trade surged from US$78 billion in 2003 to US$510 billion in 2017. China has been ASEANâs top trading partner for nine years in a row, and ASEAN Chinaâs third largest for seven consecutive years. Cumulative mutual investment exceeded US$200 billion. The number of annual mutual visits increased from 3.9 million to nearly 50 million. Over 3,800 flights travel between China and ASEAN countries every week. Practical cooperation powered by complementary strengths and shared interests has boosted our integrated development and delivered benefits to two billion people in the 11 countries. We set an example of working together to properly manage differences. Given the impact of the South China Sea issue on the smooth development of relations between China and some ASEAN countries, we all made active efforts to overcome this potential hindrance. In 2002, China and ASEAN countries signed the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC), laying a solid foundation for managing differences and strengthening cooperation. In the past 16 years, we have worked to increase mutual political trust and kept to the overall direction of amity and good-neighborliness. We have fully and effectively implemented the DOC, deepened practical maritime cooperation, launched and advanced consultations on COC to keep disputes under control and preserve stability in the South China Sea. This year has seen important progress in COC consultations. We worked out a single draft negotiating text and agreed to complete the first reading of the text within 2019. And on that basis, China is ready to work with ASEAN countries toward concluding COC consultations in three yearsâ time on the basis of consensus. Greater stability in the South China Sea will be conducive to the peace and development of East Asia as a whole. With geographic proximity, close cultural ties and interconnected development, it is only natural that China and ASEAN countries have been good neighbors, good friends and good partners. China firmly supports the building of the ASEAN Communities and ASEAN centrality in regional cooperation. Our steady and growing relationship has been underpinned by our abiding commitment in following respects: First, a commitment to mutual respect and seeking common ground while reserving differences. Our friendly relations go back a long time and rest on a solid foundation. Peace and stability is the common aspiration of all countries in the region and an overriding premise for development and prosperity. Our shared adherence to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the ASEAN Way and common preference for resolving differences through dialogue and consultations have contributed to greater mutual trust and to peace and stability in East Asia. Second, a commitment to openness and cooperation for common development. East Asian countries, with our strong economic complementarity and great potential for cooperation, have forged a bond of closely entwined interests. We made joint efforts to deepen cooperation on the industrial and value chains, advance trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, and promote East Asian integration, thus achieving win-win outcomes in the process of economic globalization. Third, a commitment to inclusiveness and mutual learning. In the unique East Asian civilization, different ethnicities, religions and cultures have long lived side by side, and shaped a regional tradition of harmony in diversity. We respect cultural diversity and each otherâs national conditions and development paths, and sought to draw on each otherâs strengths through dialogue and exchanges. This has invigorated our divergent cultures by unleashing tremendous creativity and contributed to the advancement of human society. Colleagues, The East Asian region now faces unprecedented new challenges: growing uncertainty and instability on the global horizon, protectionism and unilateralism on the rise, multilateral rules and the international order under strain, set-backs in economic globalization, flare-ups of regional hotspots, and traditional and non-traditional security threats compounding each other. It is all the more important that we, China and ASEAN, strengthen all-round cooperation to be a firm facilitator of regional peace, stability, progress and prosperity, a staunch supporter of the international order and multilateral system, and a vigorous advocate for regional integration and world multi-polarity. We need to join hands to take the China-ASEAN strategic partnership to a higher level and forge a closer China-ASEAN community with a shared future. To this end, I wish to make the following proposals: First, we need to strengthen strategic planning. Effective top-level design and sound policy implementation will generate sustained momentum for cooperation. The China-ASEAN Strategic Partnership Vision 2030ï¼which will be issued as an important outcome of this Summit, draws a blueprint for the long-term growth of China-ASEAN relations. Following the guide of Vision 2030, we should work to upgrade China-ASEAN relations by fostering stronger synergy between the BRI and ASEAN Vision 2025, strengthening the â3+xâ cooperation framework, and bolstering the three pillars of political and security cooperation, economic cooperation and people-to-people exchanges. Second, we need to deepen economic cooperation and trade. The protocol on upgrading the China-ASEAN Free Trade Area and negotiations on the product specific rules of origin have been completed. Both will serve to elevate trade liberalization and facilitation between our two sides. We look forward to the early and substantive conclusion of negotiations on the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) that contributes to the building of more robust and effective supply and value chains in the region. A few days ago, China successfully held the first International Import Expo, which was another major action to open China wider to the world. It is expected that in the coming 15 years, China will import over US$30 trillion worth of goods and over US$10 trillion in services. This will bring greater development opportunities to ASEAN and other countries. China is ready to work with ASEAN to deliver the Joint Statement on Production Capacity Cooperation and the Joint Statement on Further Deepening the Cooperation on Infrastructure Connectivity with priority given to industrial capacity cooperation in areas such as power, automobiles, ICT, rail transport and equipment manufacturing. We will steadily move forward the construction of the China-Laos Railway, China-Thailand Railway, Jakarta-Bandung Railway and other large-scale infrastructure projects in the transportation sector to help regional countries grow their economies and improve peopleâs lives. Third, we need to nurture innovation highlights. Embracing the new wave of scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation, China and ASEAN have both placed innovation high on the development agenda. Innovation has thus emerged as a new growth area of cooperation. This year is the China-ASEAN Innovation Year. The two sides will release a joint statement on ASEAN-China science, technology and innovation cooperation, explore new mechanisms for this cooperation, work together to establish science parks, and deepen the implementation of the China-ASEAN Science and Technology Partnership Program. China supports the building of the ASEAN Smart Cities Network (ASCN), and has participated in the ASEAN Smart Cities Showcase. We are ready to enter into a smart cities cooperation agreement with ASEAN to advance cooperation in policy research, standard-setting, technological innovation, market sharing, personnel training and other areas. We may set up a platform for ASCN cooperation on the basis of the China-ASEAN Information Harbor. Chinese cities, including Nanning, Xiamen, Hangzhou, Jinan and Kunming, are ready to establish partnerships with their ASEAN counterparts. China supports the building of an ASEAN tourism digital platform and will work with ASEAN on the Environmental Information Sharing Platform, forge the partnership for ecologically friendly urban development, and establish a geosciences cooperation center to boost green economy and sustainable development. Fourth, we need to cement people-to-people ties. The proud achievements of China-ASEAN cooperation owe to a large measure to the robust exchanges between our peoples. China and ASEAN have designated 2019 as the China-ASEAN Year of Media Exchanges. To enhance public knowledge and participation in our bilateral cooperation and support more people-to-people and cultural exchange programs, China will make an additional contribution to the China-ASEAN Cooperation Fund next year. The fund management team of the ASEAN Secretariat will soon be operational. China will set up the China-ASEAN Young Leaders Scholarship and launch the âBridge of the Futureâ China-ASEAN Young Leaders Training Program. In the next five years, we will invite 1,000 young talents from ASEAN countries to China for training to sow the seeds of friendship in the hearts of our peoples. Fifth, we need to expand security cooperation. Strengthening security exchanges and cooperation serves the interests of all countries. Since the beginning of this year, major progress has been made in China-ASEAN security cooperation. Last month, China and ASEAN countries successfully held the first joint maritime exercise in Zhanjiang, an important initiative for the two sides to increase mutual trust, jointly manage security risks and uphold regional stability. We hope that such exercise will be institutionalized. China is ready to work with ASEAN to set up a direct hot line between our defense authorities as soon as possible. We will carry out friendly exchanges between our military think tanks and young and middle-aged officers, deepen cooperation in such areas as disaster prevention and reduction, humanitarian assistance, military medical sciences and counter-terrorism, and explore the possibility of setting up an ASEAN warehouse of disaster relief equipment in order to make our cooperation more diversified and productive. Colleagues, Peace and stability in the South China Sea is the common aspiration of all regional countries and serves our shared interests. Thanks to the concerted efforts of China and ASEAN countries, the situation in the South China Sea has eased and consultations on the COC have been moving forward smoothly. All this testifies to the resolve of regional countries to address the South China Sea issue with a constructive approach and jointly shape the rules of the region. What has happened proves that the full and effective implementation of the DOC and progress in COC consultations are an effective means toward achieving these goals. The South China Sea is an important international shipping route. As a major trading nation, China conducts over 60 percent of its seaborne trade in goods through the South China Sea. China is committed to safeguarding the freedom of navigation and overflight in the South China Sea enjoyed by countries under international law. Non-littoral countries should respect and support the efforts made by China and ASEAN countries for peace and stability in the South China Sea. China and ASEAN countries are each otherâs opportunity for development, not threat. We must grasp the key to addressing the South China Sea issue with our own hands and overcome external impediments. While steadily advancing COC consultations, we need to conduct practical cooperation on the sea, and unlock the potential of cooperation in areas such as search and rescue, environmental protection, fishery resources conservation and coast guard. China has been improving the civilian facilities on the islands and reefs in the South China Sea. In addition to strengthening the search and rescue capabilities in the middle and southern parts of the South China Sea, we have also installed maritime observation, meteorological forecasting, environmental monitoring and disaster prevention and reduction facilities, which are all designed to provide more public goods for the region. Colleagues, When we stick together and forge ahead with firm confidence in each otherâs development, in China-ASEAN cooperation, and in the future of East Asia, we will foster a higher-quality China-ASEAN relationship that is even more fruitful and beneficial to our peoples in the next 15 years.",2018-11-15 09:54,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201811/15/WS5becd1c2a310eff303288d5c.html,chinese,South China Sea dispute
42,EnglishZhongGuoRiBao-2018-11-15 08:14-42,China-ASEAN strategic partnership a boon to Asia-Pacific,"China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) adopted here Wednesday the China-ASEAN Strategic Partnership Vision 2030, widely seen as an ideal model for cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region. The vision comes in a year that marks the 15th anniversary of the China-ASEAN strategic partnership, reflecting the common aspiration of both sides to build a region of enduring peace and stability. This new cooperation framework from two sides is supported by the three pillars of political and security cooperation, economic ties and people-to-people exchanges. In 2003, China and ASEAN decided to establish their strategic partnership, ushering in a new chapter in their relations. Over the past 15 years, the partnership has endured a changing international landscape and cooperation has continued to deliver real benefits to the countries and peoples of the region. China and ASEAN are firmly committed to good-neighborliness and friendship while enhancing political and security ties to create stability across the Asia-Pacific. Under this partnership, the two sides have properly managed sensitive issues and disputes through dialogue and negotiation in order to keep their relationship on track. While first implementing the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC), China and ASEAN arrived at a single draft negotiating text of the Code of Conduct (COC) in the South China Sea in August this year. Tensions in the South China Sea have significantly cooled down, generating positive regional momentum. Breakthroughs have also made in maritime cooperation. Both held their first ever large-scale joint exercises on maritime search and rescue in October 2017 and first-ever maritime drills in October this year. The two continue to work together on fighting terrorism, disaster relief, combating transnational crimes and dealing with cross-border communicable diseases and other challenges. China and ASEAN both promote trade and investment liberalization, an approach that has provided the backbone and engine for development and prosperity in the region. The China-ASEAN Free Trade Area (FTA), the largest regional FTA in the world in terms of population, went into effect in 2010, removing tariffs on more than 90 percent of goods traded between China and ASEAN members Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Brunei, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam. Moreover, an updated FTA was hammered out late in 2015, further facilitating trade, scaling up bilateral investment and encouraging technological cooperation. China and ASEAN are now working together to speed up establishing the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), a proposed free trade area made up of the 10 ASEAN member states and its six FTA partners -- China, Australia, India, Japan, South Korea and New Zealand, in order to further facilitate trade and investment in the region. Trade between China and ASEAN countries hit a record high in 2017, totalling 514.8 billion U.S. dollars in value, the fastest pace of growth between China and any of its major trading partners, according to the Chinese Ministry of Commerce early this year. Based on the principle of collaboration, China and ASEAN have worked to align the former's Belt and Road Initiative with the latter's development plans. Connectivity projects include the China-Laos Railway, the China-Thailand high-speed railway, and Indonesia's Jakarta-Bandung high-speed railway. China and ASEAN have advocated people-to-people exchanges and mutual learning among their different and numerous civilizations. Ties have rapidly developed in the areas of culture, education, tourism, media, science and technology, environmental protection, disaster relief, poverty reduction and youth, among others.

In the face of increasing competition and friction, will they move toward confrontation, or make an effort to manage and control their competition and differences? Will they persist with their dialogue and cooperation so they can steer the bilateral relationship toward a new model of major country relations?  It is now imperative they avoid continued expansion and escalation of their trade dispute. In a comprehensive trade war, not only would both suffer great economic losses, but economic relations, the long-term ballast for China-US relations, would become a source of confrontation. China and the US should always maintain communication and separate their political and economic affairs. The two sides should also strive to reach new agreements on free trade, fair trade, and the principle of reciprocity and mutual advantage. In the process of trying to resolve trade disputes, it is crucial that China actively strengthen its market-oriented reforms, expand its opening-up, facilitate economic restructuring, and persevere in multilateralism. The US must work to restrain its unilateral or protectionist inclinations.  It is critical to properly handle the Taiwan question. Taiwan is one of China's core interests and has always been the most important and most sensitive topic in China-US relations, which are stable only when the situation across the Taiwan Straits is stable. The US should act in strict observance of the one-China principle enshrined in their three joint communiquï¿½ï¿½s.

49,EnglishZhongGuoRiBao-2018-10-20 09:19-49,Azerbaijan important link in new Silk Road,"When the Belt and Road Initiative was launched in 2013, many countries, both in the West and in the East, were wary of it. But with the implementation of large transport and logistics projects in those countries that are located along the routes of the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, many of them today are already welcoming the Chinese initiative. More and more countries are coming to conclusion that this initiative is not a threat, but a panacea for economic growth. President Xi Jinping, who proposed the initiative, is interested in forming partnerships through dialogue where there is no place for confrontation, and where instead of alliances there is friendship. This is in sharp contrast with the foreign policy principle of ""who is not with us, is against us"", an obsolete geopolitical maneuvering adopted by certain countries. Today, China maintains partnerships at various levels with those who do not interfere in the internal affairs of China, recognize its fundamental interests and respect its sovereignty and territorial integrity, the latter being the most sensitive. In return, China refuses to get involved in the territorial disputes of others, and supports the resolution of territorial conflicts in accordance with the UN Charter and international law. This principle of China's foreign policy is also applied to the South Caucasus region, which includes Azerbaijan, Georgia and Armenia. Which brings us back to the Silk Road Economic Belt. Today the Belt and Road Initiative is being successfully promoted not only in Europe, Russia, Central Asia, Southeast Asia, but also in the South Caucasus region. Azerbaijan, which is an important player in the South Caucasus for the countries of Europe, as well as Russia and China, is a participant in the Silk Road Economic Belt. It is worth recalling that in April 2015, Azerbaijan became a founding member of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and in July that year it was granted the status of being a dialogue partner of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. In December 2015, during the visit of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev to China, the two sides signed a memorandum of understanding on joint construction of the Silk Road Economic Belt. What can Azerbaijan offer the initiative? What can Azerbaijan offer to China within the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative? The first project is the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railway. This railway, commissioned on Oct 30, 2017 and created on a route of the historical Silk Road, is designed to connect the Trans-European and Trans-Asian railway networks. On the one hand, this project is very attractive for the Central Asian regionï¼it facilitates the access of Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Afghanistan to the European and world markets. On the other hand, the railway also provides easier access of Chinese goods to European markets. As China's domestic production grows, Beijing is interested in increasing the volume of its cargo deliveries to Europe and searching for alternative routes. The Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railway might become part of such routes. The second project is the Baku International Sea Trade Port in the Alat township of Baku's Garadagh District. Today, in accordance with the instructions of President Aliyev, a free trade zone is being created in Alat, on the territory of the Baku International Sea Trade Port, which will have special significance in making Azerbaijan an international transport hub. As China sees Azerbaijan becoming an important transport and logistics center of the region, the above-mentioned projects can contribute to the development of the Belt and Road Initiative in the future. Azerbaijan values cooperation with China and is interested in deepening trade and economic cooperation with this country, since China is one of the main suppliers of products to Azerbaijan. The fact that Chinese companies have invested about $800 million in Azerbaijan means that the Azerbaijani-Chinese cooperation has got good prospects. Successful cooperation between China and Azerbaijan is confirmed by the figures. For example, in 1992 bilateral trade amounted to only $1.5 million. Yet in 2017, this figure increased by more than 800 times to reach $1.3 billion. Exports for the year increased by 63.75 percent, to $443.8 million; and imports, by 21.4 percent, to $854.5 million. The main export products from Azerbaijan to China last year were chemical products, fuel, and plastics. While Azerbaijan imported electrical goods, mechanical equipment and spare parts for them, vehicles and spare parts, clothing, ceramic products and household items from China. The positive dynamics in trade, represented by the agreement this year on the supply of Azerbaijani products to China and the opening of the wine house of Azerbaijan in Urumqi, give grounds for believing that trade between the two countries will continue to grow. According to the latest data from the State Customs Committee of Azerbaijan, the trade turnover between the two countries in the first half of the year already exceeded $616 million. Summarizing the foregoing, I would like to say that despite their geographical distance from each other Azerbaijani-Chinese relations have a bright future.First, both countries want to continue cooperation not only at the bilateral level, but also at the multilateral level. Second, Azerbaijan is attractive to China not only within the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative, but also via energy cooperation. Third, the influence of Azerbaijan at the international level is steadily growing.",2018-10-20 09:19,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201810/20/WS5bca82bca310eff30328380c.html,chinese,South China Sea dispute

Under the encouragement of the United States, however, that link is becoming stronger, with the US making continuous efforts for its two allies to strengthen their strategic partnership. On Wednesday, the foreign and defense ministers of the two countries concluded their ""two-plus-two"" talks, as they are known, in Sydney, stressing the need to bolster their defense ties, including increasing military joint exercises, amid what they described as the rapidly changing security environment in the region. In their joint statement, the two countries announced they plan to stage their first-ever fighter jet exercise, dubbed ""Bushido Guardian"", in 2019. These overtures show although it is too early to say the two Pacific powers aiming to forge a military alliance in the true sense, they are certainly one step closer to becoming what what they are, namely ""quasi-allies"". And their pledge to deepen security cooperation will not only deepen military-to-military ties between Tokyo and Canberra but also help expand each side's radius of military operations and thus enhance their defense forces' capabilities in the Asia-Pacific region. To cover up their real intention of jumping on the US bandwagon to contain China, Tokyo and Canberra pointed accusing fingers at China's so-called growing maritime assertiveness in Wednesday's joint statement, expressing concerns about the situation in the East and South China seas. Such rhetoric does not hold water. It only lays bare the hypocrisy of the US and its allies because they have either helped create or provoked the maritime disputes in the waters themselves. While Washington has instigated the South China Sea disputes in recent years, Tokyo has single-handedly ratcheted up tensions in the East China Sea by nationalizing China's Diaoyu Islands. Canberra and Tokyo should not allow the recurrence of the Cold War paranoia, that has already taken hold of the US, shape their actions.

Among other things, Pence accused China of meddling in the US' midterm elections in a bid to undermine the Donald Trump administration. Some have claimed his speech indicates the start of a new ""Cold War"". What does the speech mean for bilateral ties? Three experts share their views with China Daily's Liu Jianna. Excerpts follow: Pence speech exposes White House's anxiety In general, Pence's speech manifested that the United States indeed cares a lot about China, so much so that it has incited many grudges. Also the speech disclosed a sense of helplessness, to which the lack of new measures towards China has attested. Previously the US has been busy criticizing and meddling in China's domestic practices, but now it has shifted to accusing China of interfering with its domestic affairs, which signifies a turn of the tide in its China policies and the bilateral relationship. Overall, Pence has lashed out at China for three reasons: First, he aims to build momentum for the midterm elections as the election is tight right now and both parties have no obvious advantages. The Republican Party has targeted China in the hope of winning over voters and retaining control of the House of Representatives. Second, the Trump administration, which the right wing rhetorician Republican represented, is unduly anxious about China. The trade brawl it instigated with China six months ago has yielded modest effects, to the administration's anxiety and frustration. Pence's speech merely displayed this anxiety. Third, Pence may intend to show his allegiance to President Donald Trump by this fierce speech against China. A recent article in The New York Times cited an anonymous high-ranking official, who claimed to be part of the resistance against Trump in the administration, and many have speculated that the unnamed official was actually Pence, thus the vice-president may felt compelled to demonstrate his loyalty to the president. Given the similar style of Pence's speech and Churchill's Iron Curtain Speech in 1946, which opened the curtain on the Cold War, some claimed it marks the beginning of a new Cold War. Yet history does not simply repeat itself, a speech alone, no matter how vehement cannot instigate an all-out confrontation and spark a war. At the moment, there is no consensus on China within US society, neither have its allies offered the US the support it hoped for in confronting China. In addition, with close economic ties with the US and an extremely attractive market, China does not resemble the Soviet Union in any sense. Also, needless to say, China has no desire to be party to a ""Cold War"". Pence's speech highlights that the Trump administration thinks much of China and views it as the US' primary rival. China should attach importance to this change of dynamics in bilateral relations and make preparations, but it should remain reasonable and stay calm, avoiding overreaction as it has no need to panic and be afraid. China should adjust its macroeconomic policy, stimulate domestic demand to expand consumption on one hand, and expedite the reform and opening-up to improve enterprises' efficiency and revitalize the economy on the other. Jin Canrong, a professor at and the associate dean of the School of International Studies, Renmin University of China Election politics worsen Sino-US trade dispute Revealing that the Trump administration has taken China to be the US' top competitor, Mike Pence's speech can be seen as a watershed in the ongoing China-US trade dispute and President Trump's China policies. Aiming to push forward the US' stance in the trade frictions and coerce China to make substantial concessions on multiple fronts including trade and intellectual property protection, Pence has called upon US society and the international community to confront China. Which lays bare the Trump administration's desire to stall China's rise. Besides, making China a campaign foe provides the Republican Party a foothold in not only the upcoming midterm elections but also the presidential election in two years. The speech reveals the clearer positioning of China in the Trump administration's global strategy. Yet interpreting this as presaging a new ""Cold War"" is going too far. Regarding the speech itself, the following points needs our particular attention. First of all, Pence vehemently attacked China's practices in human rights and religious freedom, deviating from the Trump administration's previous modus operandi of not making the human rights issue a major concern in the bilateral relationship. Furthermore, Pence directed the attack against the Chinese government and portrayed it as an evil empire which completely disregards international rules. Facing the biggest crisis in international relationships in 40 years, what China needs to do is refuting the criticism while better integrating itself with the world. Time will tell what kind of country China really is. Most important, China should not treat this lightly as what happens as a result of the administration's designs will influence the bilateral relationship for the next 10 to 20 years. The key is to take initiative as much as possible and respond with more swiftness and preciseness when necessary. Zhu Feng, dean of the Institute of International Relations of Nanjing University Two sides still far from all-out confrontation As a matter of fact, it is nothing new for the two US political parties to bash China during elections. Certainly Pence has vented the administration's discontent with China with an eye on the midterm elections, which are sure to exert much influence on the status of the Republican Party and thus the presidential election in 2020. So it would be farfetched to say at the moment that the US is launching an all-out confrontation, even a new ""Cold War"" with China. It remains to be seen whether the Trump administration can and will mobilize the US' military strength to confront China. Nevertheless, a consensus has been emerged in the US to take a more aggressive and tough approach towards China. And Pence's speech, which was laden with laments, has sent a negative signal, to say the least. The inking of agreements with Canada and Mexico, together with the ongoing talks with the European Union, have enabled the administration to concentrate its concerns on China in a bid to contain the latter's growing influence. Later on the US may introduce some radical policies on trade, the South China Sea and the Tibet issue. But in assuming that it can coerce China into concessions with its extreme pressure strategy, the Trump administration is making a serious mistake. It should change its strategy in its dealings with a major country like China. Instead of firing at China and making bilateral ties a scapegoat, the US should reflect on its domestic ills with more courage and wisdom, and the Trump administration should recalibrate China-US relations as the changing dynamics it is creating in bilateral ties will have far-reaching influences on global stability and development. All in all, it is essential of China and the US to repair relations and avoid conflict at all costs.",2018-10-09 06:57,https://europe.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201810/09/WS5bbbe0c6a310eff303281209.html,chinese,South China Sea dispute

He accused China of seeking to sway the US midterm elections on Nov 6 against Trump, in retaliation for his trade policies against Beijing. âTo put it bluntly, President Trumpâs leadership is working; China wants a different American president,â Pence said in a speech at the Hudson Institute, a conservative Washington think tank. Hua said Chinaâs policy toward the US is âconsistent and clear-cutâ. âWe are committed to joining hands with the US to work for non-conflict, non-confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation,â she said. âWe urge the US to correct its wrongdoing, stop groundlessly accusing and slandering China and harming Chinaâs interests and China-US ties, and take concrete actions to maintain the sound and steady development of China-US relations,â she added. Pence also credited the US for Chinaâs rapid development, saying that China has become the second-largest economy in the world. âMuch of this success was driven by American investment in China,â he said. Hua said Chinaâs development is mainly owed to the Chinese peopleâs hard work and its mutually beneficial cooperation with countries around the world. Cui Tiankai, Chinaâs ambassador to the US, said China wants to end the trade war, but the US position keeps changing âso we donât know exactly what the US would want as prioritiesââ. âWe are ready to make a deal. We are ready to make some compromise, but it needs the goodwill from both sides,â Cui said in an interview with National Public Radio on Wednesday. Cui said that he is not seeing sufficient goodwill from the US side. âWe offered to reduce the trade deficit of the United States, for instance. And we also presented a very good proposal to the US side about the further reform and opening-up in China, some of the so-called structural issues,â he said. âThen I think more than once we had some tentative agreement between the two working teams. Then just overnight the tentative agreement was rejected, and the demand from the US changed. So this is very confusing, and this is making things very difficult,â he said. Cui also spoke about the South China Sea. âWe have sovereignty over many of the islands in the South China Sea. And this has been a long-standing position of China,â he said. Cui said that at the end of World War II, the then-Chinese government, with the help of American naval ships, took back the islands from Japan. âIt was American naval ships that sent Chinese troops to take back these islands from Japan. So we have a long-standing sovereignty over these islands, but we are also aware there are some territorial disputes,â Cui said. âAnd now weâre ready to work with other countries to have negotiations to have a final solution to such disputes,ââ he said. âWe understand this will take a long time, but in the meantime it is our intention to maintain stability there. Thatâs why we are working on a code of conduct with the ASEAN countries.â âBefore we are able to solve the territorial disputes, we should work together to maintain stability, to try to engage in some joint development of resources there, to keep a good order in the region,â Cui said. âSo I just hope that the United States will join our efforts, will be helpful, not try to disrupt the process towards peaceful negotiations.â When asked about recent news reports that the Trump administration was considering banning Chinese students from American universities, Cui said that if that were true, it is âa very dangerous situation, because so many Chinese students are studying here, and a growing number of American students are studying in Chinaâ. Cui also mentioned that a few years ago The Childrenâs Museum in Indianapolis, Indiana, hosted a Chinese cultural event that was a great success. âI was invited to address the opening ceremony, and I had a meeting with then-Governor Mike Pence. Pence was a great supporter of such people-to-people intercultural exchanges,â Cui said. âAnd the local people, they were so enthusiastic about such cultural events. So why should we cut off all these ties, all these natural ties between the two peoples? âI think between any two countries, maybe especially between China and the US, there is a certain degree of competition,â he said. âThis is only natural. But thereâs also a much larger need for cooperation. We have to cooperate whether we like it or not.â",2018-10-05 22:57,https://europe.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201810/05/WS5bb77bbca310eff303280c98.html,chinese,South China Sea dispute

During their meeting on the margins of the UN General Assembly session, Wang said that China and Britain, both permanent members of UN Security Council, should make their ties a stabilizer in a world fraught with uncertainty. China insists on its commitment to win-win cooperation and development, and will not take the West's old path that a strong country is bound to seek hegemony, Wang said. China is one of the founders and guardians of the current international system and world order, Wang said, noting that China is willing to enhance its cooperation with other countries including Britain to defend multilateralism and tackle all kinds of challenges. Wang also urged Britain to honor its commitment not to take sides regarding the South China Sea issue. He said China expects Britain to materialize its promise and show true respect for China's national sovereignty and territorial integrity. China expects Britain to do more things that promote bilateral ties, rather than those that undermine mutual trust, so as to secure a healthy and stable development of China-Britain relations. For his part, Hunt reiterated Britain's stance that it will not take sides on the South China Sea issue, and is willing to properly handle disputes through dialogue with China. He added that Britain highly values its ties with China, and is ready to build a Golden Era together with China.",2018-09-26 05:15,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201809/26/WS5baaa566a310c4cc775e80c1.html,chinese,South China Sea dispute
58,EnglishZhongGuoRiBao-2018-09-23 21:33-58,          Politics First Magazine publishes article by Ambassador Liu Xiaoming        ,"In its autumn party conference issue, the Politics First Magazine published a signed article by Ambassador Liu Xiaoming entitled How to Ensure the Steady and Sustained Development of the China-UK ""Golden Era"". The full text is as follows: In more than eight years as Chinese Ambassador to the UK, I witnessed many extraordinary moments. The most impressive is President Xi Jinping's state visit to the UK in 2015, which ushered in the China-UK ""Golden Era"". This milestone event set the course for the long-term development of China-UK relations, gave new impetus to the cooperation between the two countries across the board, and raised the bilateral relationship onto a new level. The ""Golden Era"" is not a matter of contingency but the strategic consensus of China and the UK. As permanent members of the UN Security Council, major economies and responsible countries who take as their mission to safeguard peace and security and promote development in the world, both China and the UK perceive and advance their bilateral relationship from a global perspective and strategic height. During Prime Minister May's visit to China early this year, the leaders of the two countries agreed to build a more strategic, practical, global and inclusive China-UK ""Golden Era"". At the ninth China-UK Strategic Dialogue in Beijing this summer, the two sides had in-depth discussions on bilateral relations, as well as regional and international issues, which further enriched the strategic significance of the ""Golden Era"". A sound, vibrant and mutually-beneficial China-UK relationship is not only in the common interests of the two countries but also conducive to world peace, stability and prosperity. The ""Golden Era"" is not an empty slogan because there have been many concrete ""golden fruits"". From January to May this year, trade between China and the UK was more than $32.4 billion, with British export to China increasing by nearly 30 per cent. New opportunities are emerging as China lifts the ban on British boneless beef from cattle less than 30 months old and the China-UK joint trade and investment review makes scheduled progress. The UK has become China's second largest investment destination and second largest source of capital in the European Union, with Chinese investment in the UK surpassing $19.2 billion and British investment in China in the first half of this year increasing by 82.5% over the same period last year. London has become the largest RMB offshore market outside China, and seven Chinese banks have set up branches in Britain. Mutual visits are expected to surpass 1.5 million this year, thanks to 150 passenger flights every week and five new direct flight routes already opened this year. There are 170,000 Chinese students, and 29 Confucius Institutes and 156 Confucius Classrooms with 160,000 registered students in Britain, more than anywhere else in Europe. The ""Golden Era"" is not ""mission accomplished"". On the contrary, it continues to drive forward China-UK cooperation with new and huge opportunities at the critical time for development in both countries, namely, the new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics and the new stage for building a ""global Britain"". The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is becoming a new highlight. As a ""natural partner"" for China in advancing the BRI, the UK is the first among major Western countries to apply to join the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and contribute to the AIIB special fund, and the first to appoint a BRI special envoy and set up an Expert Board. The two sides are also working vigorously to match their development strategies and industrial policies with a view to creating favorable conditions for a high-standard trade and investment arrangement. In the field of science, technology and innovation, China-UK cooperation enjoys a promising prospect. The two countries issued the Joint Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation Cooperation and new platforms for this cooperation, such as Pitch@Palace China initiated by The Duke of York, are emerging. China and the UK are now standing at a new historical starting point. The two sides should keep abreast with the trend of the times, seize the development opportunities and expand the scope of cooperation, so as to move China-UK relations forward. That requires a strategic partnership characterised by mutual respect and trust. Having experienced various vicissitudes, China and the UK have built a mature and stable relationship. The key to such relationship lies in mutual respect, equality, and mutual accommodation of each other's core interests and major concerns. This is the political foundation of China-UK relations that the two countries need to take concrete steps to consolidate. These include respecting each other's sovereignty, security and development interests, and refraining from actions that undermine each other's core interests and undercut mutual political and strategic trust. That is the only way to keep the China-UK relationship on the right track. China and the UK should also continue to be partners in win-win cooperation. This year marks the 40th anniversary of China's reform and opening up. Going forward, China will open its door wider to the world, which means more opportunities for China-UK trade and economic cooperation. The two countries need to make the ""pie of common interests"" bigger by deepening cooperation on infrastructure development, equipment manufacturing, high and new technology, nuclear power and financial services, and by exploring cooperation on new industries and new modes of business, such as artificial intelligence, big data, clean energy and digital economy. The BRI calls for more early harvests through high-standard, high-quality and sustainable cooperation between China and the UK. That could be an important subject for high-level talks at next year's second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation. The first China International Import Expo in November, where Britain will be a country of honor, will be a great opportunity for British companies to showcase their products and services to China and to the world. In international affairs, China and the UK should work as close partners. In a world of deeper globalisation and converging interests of various countries, greater openness, better connectivity and win-win cooperation have become the overarching trend. As supporters for the multilateral system, economic globalisation and free trade, China and the UK should stand firmly together in face of the grave threats to international trade, to support the rule-based international order and the multilateral trade regime, and to oppose unilateralism and protectionism. The two countries should also enhance cooperation at the United Nations, G20 and World Trade Organisation, and work hand in hand to advance reform in the international governance system, address global challenges such as climate change, terrorism, cyber security and wildlife protection, and seek political settlements to hotspot issues such as the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue, the Iran nuclear issue and the situation in Syria and Myanmar. In the South China Sea, the situation is developing in a positive direction thanks to the concerted efforts of China and ASEAN countries. The disputing parties having returned to the right track of settling the disputes through negotiation and consultation. China hopes the UK will respect the efforts of China and other regional countries in safeguarding peace and stability in the South China Sea, refrain from interfering in the South China Sea issue and avoid actions that may jeopardise peace and stability in the region. There is also huge potential for China and the UK, two major civilizations with splendid culture, to learn from each other and enhance cultural exchanges. The two countries should enhance cooperation and exchanges on education, culture, science, technology and tourism, between the young people and at the sub-national level. There have been many stories told about the exchanges and friendship between the Chinese and British people, and the two countries should continue to do more to carry on this tradition and cement public support for China-UK relations.",2018-09-23 21:33,https://africa.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201809/23/WS5ba79635a310c4cc775e7bc7.html,chinese,South China Sea dispute

Bilateral ties suffered a severe setback when Japan ""nationalized"" China's Diaoyu Islands in the East China Sea six years ago. Since then relations remained somewhat frosty until the beginning of this year, when Japan appeared eager to improve bilateral relations. Following the visits of several Japanese officials to China, Premier Li Keqiang paid an official visit to Japan in May, when the two sides vowed to further improve China-Japan relations. Since the process did not come by easily, Japan should be sensitive to China's national and security issues. For that, Japan must see China as a cooperative partner, not a threat as it does now. In particular, Japan should exercise extreme caution when it comes to China's islands in the South China Sea, as it had illegally occupied them during World War II, before China reclaimed them. Japan has already assumed the right to exercise ""collective self-defense"" and engage in military action if one of its allies were attacked. Added to this, Abe's attempts to revise Article 9 of Japan's pacifist Constitution to exercise the right to use force to settle international disputes does not augur well for Japan's neighbors given Japan's wartime past.",2018-09-17 21:57,https://africa.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201809/17/WS5b9fb2b0a31033b4f4656845.html,chinese,South China Sea dispute

A British Navy spokesman claimed that the HMS Albion, a 22,000-ton amphibious warship on its way to Vietnam from Japan, was conducting a ""freedom of navigation operation"". It is not the first time a British warship has entered Chinese waters under this pretext. And it is a pretext, as freedom of navigation in the South China Sea has never been a problem. Hundreds of thousands of commercial ships pass through the strategic waterway each year transporting an estimated $5 trillion worth of goods. Not a single one has found its freedom of navigation compromised. Despite their maritime disputes, China and other regional countries are making progress on agreeing a code of conduct for the waters, and the situation has remained stable thanks to their joint efforts to enhance cooperation and mutual trust. It is the continuous provocative maneuvers by navies from outside the region that have escalated tensions and threatened the stability and endangered maritime safety in the South China Sea. There is no international law that justifies even ""innocent passage"" of a foreign country's military vessels through other's territorial waters without permission. The reckless actions by the British navy to challenge China's sovereignty can only be explained by the country wanting to curry favor with the United States. The US has often grumbled that its allies have been remiss in not following its lead in conducting ""freedom of navigation"" operations in the South China Sea. Now that it is eyeing the US as an economic lifeline after it exits the European Union â the United Kingdom is no doubt eager to seize whatever opportunity it can to get into Washington's good books. But by trying to revive the ""special relationship"" in this way now it is no longer the gateway to continental Europe, the UK risks losing more than it can gain. China and the UK had agreed to actively explore the possibility of discussing a free trade agreement after Brexit, but any act that harms China's core interests will only put a spanner in the works.",2018-09-06 19:41,https://africa.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201809/06/WS5b911253a31033b4f4654a8e.html,chinese,South China Sea dispute

There had been speculation that Manila was repeating an old trick and the BRP Gregorio del Pilar had been deliberately stranded on Half Moon Shoal, which China calls Banyue Jiao, as a Philippine navy vessel was deliberately grounded on Ren'ai Jiao in 1999, in an attempt to claim the sovereignty rights over the reef and its surrounding waters. Nearly 20 years have passed and the Philippines has yet to tow away the rusty ship, which it has been using as a military outpost. Since then the Sino-Philippine relationship has been on something of a roller-coaster ride, hitting its nadir when the administration of Benigno Aquino III, encouraged by the United States, took a confrontational stance toward Beijing, and only coming back to the normal track after President Rodrigo Duterte took steps to answer Beijing's call to reset the strained ties after he took office in 2016. As part of the two sides' efforts to build trust, they reached a consensus to maintain a ""sound and stable"" situation in the South China Sea. That is why Philippine defense officials notified their Chinese counterparts immediately after the accidental grounding of the frigate to avoid any misunderstanding, and why, in a show of goodwill, the Chinese Navy offered to help with its recovery. China and other regional countries have been working together to maintain peace and security in the South China Sea, and the swift and amicable end to the incident has not allowed it to be played up by other countries seeking to drive a wedge between them. By continually enhancing mutual trust and seeking to peacefully resolve their territorial disputes, countries in the region have turned a cold shoulder to those trying to stir up trouble in the waters. At the end of June, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and China agreed to move forward with negotiations on the proposed Code of Conduct in the South China Sea based on the framework they had agreed.",2018-09-04 21:23,https://africa.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201809/04/WS5b8e874ca310add14f38996f.html,chinese,South China Sea dispute
65,EnglishZhongGuoRiBao-2018-08-30 21:27-65,Military exercise should not be misinterpreted: China Daily editorial,"Despite some wild speculation, China's upcoming joint military exercise with Russia and Mongolia is nothing untoward. It has become a routine practice for China and Russia to hold smaller scale military exercises, and the two neighbors have also regularly participated in and led multilateral drills under the framework of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization in recent years. The planned drills scheduled for Sept 11-15 are simply on a larger scale than usual. Codenamed Vostok-2018, or East-2018, the exercise will reportedly involve almost 300,000 troops and more than 1,000 military aircraft, with China sending about 3,200 troops, more than 900 pieces of military hardware and a combined total of 30 fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters. Thanks to efforts from both sides, Beijing and Moscow have made much headway in forging a comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination, and military-to-military exchanges have played their part in strengthening mutual trust. In fact, bilateral ties are in excellent shape at present, meaning it is only natural that the two neighbors should choose to strengthen their military-to-military ties, as these are a barometer of the bilateral relationship. China and Russia are two important forces in maintaining peace and stability in the region and beyond. Closer and smoother coordination between their military forces will put them in a better position to respond to potential threats and even a crisis in the region, which is unsettled because of territorial disputes and the tensions relating to the Korean Peninsula. On China's part, as it is increasingly an active contributor to international peacekeeping efforts, joint military exercises also help improve its military personnel's combat capabilities and cooperative skills with counterparts in foreign military forces. The suspicions and concerns surrounding the upcoming Russia-China-Mongolia military exercise stem from the Cold War mentality in the West and display a double standard: The frequent war games conducted by the United States and its allies around the world are well received and even lauded as a show of solidarity, while those that China and non-Western countries participate in are viewed with suspicion. One element to the exercise that has been remarked upon is the inclusion of simulated nuclear weapons attacks, with the rationale for this being flipped, to make it seem a threat rather than a response to such an attack.",2018-08-30 21:27,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201808/30/WS5b87f0bba310add14f388b96.html,chinese,South China Sea dispute

68,EnglishZhongGuoRiBao-2018-08-20 07:36-68,Beijing opposes Washington's military report,"China has voiced strong opposition to a report by the US Defense Department on China's military and security developments, saying it misinterprets China's strategic intentions and hypes a so-called Chinese military threat. The report, released on Thursday, distorts the relations and situation across the Taiwan Straits, said Senior Colonel Wu Qian, a spokesman for the Ministry of National Defense, in a statement on Friday. ""The release of such reports year after year has harmed the mutual trust, and we ask the United States to abandon the Cold War mindset and adopt an objective and rational attitude toward China's defense and military developments,"" he said. China has firmly taken the path of peaceful development and remained a contributor to world peace and international order, Wu said, and its military has borne considerable international peacekeeping and disaster relief responsibilities, earning ""universal praise from the international community"". He said China's military modernization is aimed at safeguarding its sovereignty and security, as well as world peace and stability, and the military reform, weapons development and cyberspace defense are justifiable and reasonable. Wu urged the US to adhere to the one-China policy and the principles of the three joint communiques, and to discreetly deal with Taiwan-related issues. ""It is an ironclad fact that Taiwan is a part of China,"" he said, ""The Chinese military will as always stand firm in safeguarding China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as peace and stability in the Taiwan Straits."" China's activities on islands and reefs in the South China Sea are legitimate in safeguarding national territory and meet people's demand so as to better fulfill its international obligations. China is also committed to resolving disputes peacefully through negotiations with related parties. The real threat to regional peace and stability is the US sending warplanes and ships to the South China Sea in the name of ""freedom of navigation"", he said. Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said on Saturday that the report ignores and misjudges China's efforts in safeguarding its territorial sovereignty and security interests. He called on the US to refrain from such irresponsible reports and make efforts to maintain stable growth of relations between the two countries and their militaries. Teng Jianqun, director of the China Institute of International Studies' Department for US Studies, said the report, like other recent US acts, serves to smear China and depict a ""China threat"". ""The report is their routine depiction and has its own purpose and strategy,"" he said. The annual report generally looks at countries the US thinks could challenge its military dominance, said Li Haidong, a US studies researcher at China Foreign Affairs University. This year it also touches on such issues as Taiwan and investment security. ""And the main reason is that US China policy has undergone some major changes and adjustments,"" he said. Li said the US has considered China a strategic competitor since late last year.",2018-08-20 07:36,http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201808/20/WS5b79ff13a310add14f38690f.html,chinese,South China Sea dispute
69,EnglishZhongGuoRiBao-2018-08-19 07:07-69,China opposes US report judging its military and security development: Defense Ministry spokesperson,"BEIJING - A spokesperson for the Chinese military said it resolutely opposes a report by the US Department of Defense on China's military and security developments, claiming the report misinterpreted China's strategic intention and hyped up the so-called ""China military threat."" The US Department of Defense's 2018 report to Congress also distorted relations and situation across the Taiwan Strait, said Wu Qian, the spokesperson for China's Ministry of National Defense, Friday. ""We have lodged solemn representations to the US side over the report,"" said Wu. China, as a facilitator of world peace, a contributor to global development and a maintainer of international order, has firmly taken the path of peaceful development and steadfastly pursued a national defense policy that is defensive in nature, he said. In recent years, Chinese soldiers and officers have carried out more and more missions involving peacekeeping and disaster relief in foreign lands, and borne more international responsibilities and provided more public security goods. ""The contribution and endeavor by China have won universal praise from the international community,"" said Wu. China's efforts to strengthen modernization of its military aims at safeguarding its sovereignty, security, and development interests, as well as for safeguarding world peace, stability and prosperity. China's military reform, weapons and equipment development and its defense capability building in cyberspace are justifiable and reasonable, said Wu, noting that US accusations in the report are pure conjecture. ""It is an iron-clad fact that Taiwan is a part of China,"" Wu stressed. ""We urge the US side to adhere to the one-China policy and the principle of the three joint communiques, and to discreetly deal with Taiwan-related issues."" The Chinese military will as always stand firm in safeguarding China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, Wu said. China's stance on maritime issues is consistent and clear-cut, and China is committed to resolving disputes peacefully through direct negotiations with related parties. China's peaceful construction activities on the islands and reefs in the South China Sea, which are legitimate rights of a sovereign state, aim at safeguarding national territory and meeting demand of the people, so as to better fulfill its international responsibilities and obligations, the spokesperson said. The US side, which has frequently sent warplanes and vessels to the South China Sea in the name of ""freedom of navigation,"" and caused tensions, is a real threat to the regional peace and stability, said the spokesperson.",2018-08-19 07:07,http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201808/19/WS5b78a6b5a310add14f38683f.html,chinese,South China Sea dispute
70,EnglishZhongGuoRiBao-2018-08-18 08:56-70,Trade concerns must not weaken confidence,"Despite challenges, there are a thousand reasons to make China-US relations a success, and not a single one to break them Does US President Donald Trump have the correct idea about gain and loss? ""Last year, we lost $500 billion on trade with China,"" Trump has said. According to US statistics, last year, the US imported about $505 billion worth of Chinese goods and exported about $130 billion of goods to China, a difference of about $375 billion. So how could it lose $500 billion? Now let us take the year 2015 as an example. The United States exported goods worth $116.2 billion and services valued at $47.9 billion to China, and its income through companies in China was $355.8 billionï¼a total of $519.9 billion. China, on the other hand, exported goods valued at $481.9 billion and services worth $15 billion to the US, and its income via companies in the US was $25.6 billion, which added up to $522.5 billion. Almost the same amount. More interestingly, the top 10 exporters in China to the US are not Chinese mainland companies but original equipment manufacturers funded by investors from Taiwan, Singapore or the US. Futile argument for wrong cause Miscalculation leads to misjudgment. Misjudgment leads to wrong policy. And this is true for the Trump administration. Still, many argue the US does need to be tough with China, because China has taken advantage of the US by violating World Trade Organization rules and stealing its technologies. But does the US hold the correct view on WTO rules? Since it joined the WTO in 2001, China has substantially reduced import tariffs. In fact, by 2010 it had fulfilled all its tariff reduction commitmentsï¼reducing average tariff level from 15.3 percent in 2001 to 9.8 percent, and average tariff rate on farm products from 23.2 percent to 15.2 percent, or about one-fourth of the global average and far lower than those imposed by developing countries (56 percent) and developed nations (39 percent). You could challenge that by saying China imposed higher automobile tariffs than the US did. I acknowledge the first half of the argument but disagree with the latter half. China entered the WTO as a developing country, so it would have been unrealistic, rather unfair, to demand absolute reciprocity between China and the US in terms of market access. Besides, China may be the second-largest economy in the world, but its per capita GDP still ranks the 71st globally. Some 30 million people in China still live in abject poverty. And it has to create about 15 million urban jobs every year, and take measures to make life easier for about 87 million people with disabilities. Steven Brill, a New York lawyer and journalist, discusses the poverty problem in the US since the 1960s in his book Tailspin. So what does Tailspin say is the poverty line in the US? For a household: $48,500 a year. But in China it is $4,080 a year, which means one-twelfth of the US standard. Foreign firms to benefit from lower tariffs The Chinese authorities recently announced the lowering of tariffs on 1,449 import items, covering almost all aspects of daily consumption, including clothing and footwear, home appliances, food and beverage, cosmetics and personal care products. In this round of reduction, the average tariff rate of the goods involved was reduced from 15.7 percent to 6.9 percent. In particular, the average tariff rates for cars and auto spare parts were reduced to 15 percent and 6 percent, respectively. Moreover, China has vowed to increase its imports. In November, it will host the first China International Import Expo in Shanghai, opening up its market wider. And in the next 15 years, it is expected to import $24 trillion worth of goods. All this means more benefits for foreign companies. The other major grouse the Trump administration has is related to intellectual property rights protection. But does it hold the correct view on the issue? When China joined the WTO, it also entered into the Agreement on Trade-Related IPR to bring its IP laws to the international level. China was also keen to transition from being a manufacturing-based economy to an innovation-led economy, which it knows is possible only if it allocates more funds to and expands its research and development sector. Accordingly, China has made IPR protection the centerpiece for improving the property rights protection system. Last year, it paid $28.6 billion for IP use, and recently it revised the Trademark Law and Law Against Unfair Competition to further strengthen IPR protection. According to the latest World Intellectual Property Organization data, Chinese companies registered more than 1.3 million patents in 2017, an increase of 14.2 percent year-on-year. Interestingly, the top filing company at the European Patent Office last year was Chinese tech giant Huawei. In high-growth sectors such as blockchain, China filed more than half of the 406 blockchain-related patent applications last year. Many Western businesses have claimed that pursuing IP cases in Chinese courts is not worthwhile, as the damages awarded are too small. Some estimates indicate that patent holders currently receive about 36 percent of the damages they seek in litigation, with compensation awards averaging about $12,400 and legal fees being between $1,550 and $4,650. Higher damages for IPR violations But last July at the National Financial Work Conference, President Xi Jinping said that China ""must step up efforts to punish illegal infringement of IPR and force infringers to pay a heavy price"". That was reflected in the proposed amendment to the Patent Law, which is still under review. It increases the damages in IPR cases from $1,550 to $155,000ï¼to a maximum of $775,000. And in a landmark case, three Chinese shoemakers were ordered to pay New Balance $1.5 million for copying the sneaker brand's logo. So why does the US still accuse China of IP theft and forced IP transfer? China's foreign investment regulations have no mandatory requirement of technology transfer. Those who accuse China of forced technology transfer have never presented even one specific case as an example. As for the technologies obtained through commercial cooperation, they are the outcome of voluntary deals between companies, and have nothing to do with forced IP transfer. What about the Trump administration's view on market access? The Trump administration criticizes China for ""closing"" its market. If that is true, how could foreign investors register nearly 30,000 new companies in China in the first half of this year, up 96.6 percent year-on-year? Capital doesn't flow into a market with an unattractive investment environment and poor profit prospects. Being a latecomer to market economy, China does need to improve its business environment. But China has been taking every possible step to do that. For instance, the latest negative list has reduced the restricted items for foreign investment by 24 percent to 48. A broader market is unfolding in China This year marks the 40th anniversary of China's reform and opening-up. At the 2018 Boao Forum for Asia, Xi reaffirmed that China will resolutely advance reform and opening-up while announcing a series of major measures for further opening up the Chinese market. A broader market is unfolding. All said and done, thanks to the foundation laid by the previous generations both in China and the US and the expectations of peoples in both countries, I believe the US and China will eventually resolve their trade disputes and resume their win-win partnership. As a Western saying goes, there's nothing new under the sun. China and the US have witnessed many difficulties and challenges during their nearly four decades of diplomatic relations. From Jimmy Carter to Ronald Reagan, from George H.W. Bush to Bill Clinton, China-US ties have gone through cyclical motions. From the 1980s through the end of the 20th century, I can cite many examples, such as the Milky Way Incident (1993), former Taiwan leader Lee Teng-hui's visit to the US (1995), the Taiwan Straits missile crisis (1996), US bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade (1999), which put Sino-US ties to test. The EP3 aircraft collision over the South China Sea on April 1, 2001, triggered Chinese people's indignation at the US. In the same year, George W. Bush told the ABC in an interview on completing 100 days in office that the US would ""do our utmost to help Taiwan defend itself"". Those were indeed tough times. But joint efforts for and pursuit of healthy bilateral relations helped the two countries to overcome those difficulties. Cooperation trend too strong to be stopped It is true that for the US, China today is a ""strategic competitor"", not the ""constructive strategic partner"" it was at the turn of the century. But then consider the following facts: In 2002, only 230,000 Chinese visited the US. In 2017, the figure rose to 3 million, a 13-fold increase. Before 2008, China's investment in the US was less than $500 million; by 2016 it had risen to $46 billion. From 2000 through 2015, Chinese companies in the US employed 100,000 local people. Which means incidents and policies can sometimes disrupt the trend of China-US cooperation but never stop it, because the driving force of common interests does not change. Apart from the many positive examples in bilateral fields, there have been quite a few successful cases of US-China cooperation on regional and global issues, such as climate change, counterterrorism, epidemics, narcotics control, the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue and the Iran nuclear dealï¼albeit Trump has pulled the US out of the Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear deal. By saying so, I do not mean to downplay the challenges we're facing but to emphasize that we need a historical perspective to analyze the situation we are in today. To conclude my argument, I would say people's will overwhelms politicians' prejudice and finally determines the policy. China-US cooperation serves the interests of both sides. And ""there are a thousand reasons to make the China-US relationship a success, and not a single reason to break it"".",2018-08-18 08:56,http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201808/18/WS5b776ebca310add14f386757.html,chinese,South China Sea dispute
